# Interface Segregation Principle

### Par la pratique du RPN Calculator

# Slide 2

A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use
or
clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use
Smells
Fat interface/Class with lot of methods
Interface has multiple responsibilities
Difficulties to expose a subset of responsibilities

ISP relates to important characteristics - cohesion and coupling.
Ideally your components must be highly tailored. It improves code robustness and maintainability.

ISP is important for user of your interface, if I want to manipulate headers do I have to bother with session management…

The Key Is Minimizing Coupling Surface
=> Decreases Coupling Between Objects
Can be interfaces Or Classes (Facade Pattern), Or Packages, Or Layers (View Layer, etc)
=> Inverts The Dependency

Enforcing ISP gives you following bonuses:
High cohesion - better understandability, robustness
Low coupling - better maintainability, high resistance to changes
