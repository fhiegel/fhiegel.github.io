Passionate developer; whatever the programming language, everything is an excuse to create and enjoy it.
Through my various experiences, I discovered and sharpened my craft practices, in particular through sharing workshops and collective continuous learning.

By leading communities of practice, by facilitating the internalization of training or even by gamifying practical workshops, I hope to be able to transmit this passion to the people around me and help them learn the technical skills that make them dream.
