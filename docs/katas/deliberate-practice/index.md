# What is Deliberate Practice?

Deliberate practice refers to a special type of practice that is purposeful and systematic.
 While regular practice might include mindless repetitions, deliberate practice requires focused attention and
 is conducted with the specific goal of improving performance. When Ben Hogan carefully reconstructed each step of his
 golf swing, he was engaging in deliberate practice. He wasn't just taking cuts. He was finely tuning his technique.
