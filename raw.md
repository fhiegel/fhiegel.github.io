> Pair programming is a simple, straightforward concept. Two programmers
> work side-by-side at one computer, continuously collaborating on the
> same design, algorithm, code, and test. It produces a higher quality
> of code in about half the time than that produced by the summation of
> their solitary efforts. However, nothing is simple where people and
> personalities are involved\--especially people who are accustomed to
> working alone. The leap to pair programming for a variety of software
> development projects is one that yields many benefits. However, it is
> also one that requires careful thought and planning.
>
> Written as instruction for team members and leaders new to pair
> programming and as an improvement guide for experienced pair
> programmers, *Pair Programming Illuminated* explains both the
> principles underlying this method and its best practices. The authors,
> drawing on their own extensive experience, explain what works and what
> does not, what should be emphasized and what should be avoided. Two
> case studies further illuminate pair programming in practice: one in
> the context of extreme programming (XP), with which it often is
> associated, and one linked to a more disciplined software engineering
> process.
>
> - Principles for selecting partners
> - Practical advice, such as furniture set-up, pair rotation, and weeding out bad pairs
> - Seven habits of effective pair programmers
>
> Special appendices include:
>
> - A pair programming tutorial
> - An economic analysis of pair programming
> - An introduction to test-driven development
>
> With this book in hand, you will quickly discover how pair programming
> fits the needs of your own organization or project. You then will see
> exactly how to get started with this method, and how to do it right.

### Dedication

> From Laurie to Danny, Christopher, Kimberly, and Brian Your love is
> the greatest gift of all. From Bob to Julie, Alex, and Chelsea
>

### Preface

> This purpose of this book is to provide you with lots of information
> on pair programming. If you are already pairing, then the book will
> give you additional insights and techniques to make your pairing even
> more successful. We answer many of the questions and concerns that you
> may have about using the technique.
>
> In [Part One](#part-i-gaining-understanding), our aim is for
> you to gain greater understanding about pair programming. We\'ll
> describe the technique and will be looking at pair programming from
> many perspectives---from those of you who want to try and those who
> would rather not try, from those of you who are employees trying to
> convince their managers to let them try and those who are managers who
> are trying to convince their employees to try.
>
> In [Part Two](#part-ii-getting-started-with-pair-programming),
> we deal with some operational details of pairing---such as furniture
> and hints and tips for daily operation. We discuss the importance of
> pair rotation and how that can lead to better knowledge management.
>
> In [Part Three](#part-iii-pair-programming-partner-picking-principles-1),
> we explain benefits and shortcomings of many different kinds of pairs
> and the context in which each kind of pair works best. We offer ideas
> to help enhance the pairing and solutions for most problem pairings.
> Unfortunately, not all pairs will work, and we provide ways to
> recognize the potential problems before they happen.
>
> [Part Four](#part-iv-case-studies-of-pair-programming-in-a-software-process)
> gives two case studies of pair programming in different methodologies.
> The first describes pairing in Extreme Programming (XP), while the
> second discusses the Collaborative Software Process (CSP). In both
> cases, pair programming is an essential ingredient to success.
>
> We conclude in [Part Five](#part-v-in-closing) with suggestions
> for future directions, and we enumerate Seven Habits of Effective Pair
> Programmers.
>

### Who Should Read This Book

> We\'ve written this book for software development team members and
> their managers. When we use the term \"software development team,\" it
> goes beyond those who write production code. For example, this book is
> certainly appropriate for team leaders and coaches, GUI designers,
> architects, and QA folks. This book was also written for educators who
> would like to try pair programming with their students. Depending on
> your role, may we suggest the following process for reading this book:
>
> - Software developers and team leaders/coaches who haven\'t yet tried pair programming will find
> [Part One](#part-i-gaining-understanding) very useful. All should read Chapters[1](#chapter-1.-introduction)--[3](#chapter-3.-the-seven-synergistic-behaviors-of-pair-programming)
> very carefully. If you are trying to convince your manager to
> transition to pair programming, [Chapter 4](#chapter-4.-overcoming-management-resistance-to-pair-programming)
> will be helpful. If you would like to convince your peers to give pair
> programming a shot, [Chapter 5](#chapter-5.-gaining-support-and-acceptance-from-your-peers)
> is for you. If you are currently being forced into pair programming,
> [Chapter 6](#chapter-6.-transitioning-to-pair-programming-by-choice) will
> give you some guidance.[Chapter 7](#chapter-7.-problem-problems) will prepare you for some
> potential problems you may encounter. Then you can move on to the
> chapters in [Part Two](#part-ii-getting-started-with-pair-programming) to get into
> some of the more operational issues you will need to deal with in a
> transition to pair programming. [Chapter 27](#chapter-27.-seven-habits-of-effective-pair-programmers),
> \"Seven Habits of Effective Pair Programmers,\" will get you started
> on the right track. [Appendix A](#appendix-a.-pair-programming-tutorial), \"Pair Programming
> Tutorial,\" can be used to help you transition a team or convince a
> team to take the pair programming plunge.
>
> - Software developers and team
> leaders/coaches who are currently doing pair programming should start
> skimming Chapters
> [1](#chapter-1.-introduction)--[3](#chapter-3.-the-seven-synergistic-behaviors-of-pair-programming).
> Much of this information will be review for you, but you may pick up
> some additional insight. Then you can move on to the chapters in
> [Part Two](#part-ii-getting-started-with-pair-programming) to
> get into some of the more operational issues. [Part
> Three](#part-iii-pair-programming-partner-picking-principles-1)
> will be particularly important in guiding you to choosing the best
> pair for the task at hand. [Chapter
> 27](#chapter-27.-seven-habits-of-effective-pair-programmers),
> \"Seven Habits of Effective Pair Programmers,\" will be a good grand
> finale for you. How many of these habits do you practice? [Appendix
> D](#appendix-d.-an-introduction-to-test-driven-development)
> provides information about including Test-Driven Development with pair
> programming.
>
> - QA personnel might be wondering how to
> handle a development team that has practiced or plans to practice pair
> programming. Chapters
> [1](#chapter-1.-introduction)--[4](#chapter-4.-overcoming-management-resistance-to-pair-programming)
> will give you a solid understanding of the technique and its benefits.
> Chapters [10](#chapter-10.-other-issues-to-consider) and
> [26](#chapter-26.-moving-ahead-going-beyond) also discuss the
> possibility of pair programming as a substitute to code inspections.
> [Appendix
> D](#appendix-d.-an-introduction-to-test-driven-development)
> discusses the composition of pair programming and a testing technique
> called Test-Driven Development.
>
> - Managers should start by reading
> Chapters
> [1](#chapter-1.-introduction)--[4](#chapter-4.-overcoming-management-resistance-to-pair-programming)
> and [Chapter 7](#chapter-7.-problem-problems) of [Part
> One](#part-i-gaining-understanding). Then, if you are trying to
> convince a team to try pair programming, [Chapter
> 6](#chapter-6.-transitioning-to-pair-programming-by-choice) will
> be helpful. It advises you to run a Pair Programming Tutorial,
> outlined in [Appendix
> A](#appendix-a.-pair-programming-tutorial), with your
> team.[Part Two](#part-ii-getting-started-with-pair-programming)
> provides information about operational issues of pair programming, and
> [Chapter 26](#chapter-26.-moving-ahead-going-beyond) provides
> information on some directions pair programming may lead to.
>
> - Educators should read the first four
> chapters of [Part One](#part-i-gaining-understanding) to gain a
> good basic understanding of the technique. Chapters
> [8](#chapter-8.-workplace-layout),
> [10](#chapter-10.-other-issues-to-consider),
> and[11](#chapter-11.-tips-n-tricks) provide some tactical
> information about your students. Depending on the skill level and mix
> of your students, choose some chapters in [Part
> One](#part-i-gaining-understanding). [Chapter
> 26](#chapter-26.-moving-ahead-going-beyond) should appeal to
> your academic research interests, and [Chapter
> 27](#chapter-27.-seven-habits-of-effective-pair-programmers)
> provides good information to share with
> your students. [Appendix
> C](#appendix-c.-pair-programming-in-the-classroom) was written
> with educators in mind and provides some sound tactical advice for
> using pair programming in the classroom.

> Foundation. The NSF has funded research on student pair programming at
> both North Carolina State University and the University of California,
> Santa Cruz.
>
> Bob: First of all, I\'d like to thank my family. My wife Julie has
> always supported my professional efforts even though I often stay up
> too late working. She has juggled her job and the family and has put
> up with all of the deadlines. Additionally she has always been there
> to handle the home life when I\'ve been too busy. I also thank our
> kids, Alex and Chelsea, for helping to enrich and fulfill our lives.
> I\'d like to thank my parents for laying the foundation that has
> helped me get where I am today. I\'d also like to thank Martin Griss
> for the years of being a great mentor, colleague, and most
> importantly, a friend. Last, I would be remiss without thanking my
> coauthor Laurie. It has been a real treat to watch her grow from a
> brand new graduate student into a highly regarded, professional
> colleague. It has been a real treat for me to \"pair-write\" this book
> with her.
>
> Much of the writing of this book was accomplished while Bob was on

# Part I: Gaining Understanding

> At face value, pair programming is a very simple concept. Two
> programmers work together at one computer on the same task. Done.
>
> If it was that easy and it worked, that would be all there is to say.
> There are, however, people and personalities involved. These people
> and personalities have programmed by themselves for a long time now
> and need to be convinced that pairing would make things better. Or,
> they work with peers who think it would be better to work alone. There
> could be a development team that might consist of heroic \"Lone
> Rangers\" who wouldn\'t get down off their pedestal to share any glory
> with anyone. There are managers who manage programmers who have always
> worked alone. Why in the world would he or she want to pair them up,
> or allow them to pair up if they wanted to? Doubtlessly, a team
> culture is hard to change.
>
> The purpose of [Part One](#part-i-gaining-understanding) is to
> help you understand the technique of pair programming from several
> different perspectives---development, management, QA, and so on.
> Chapters
> [1](#chapter-1.-introduction)--[7](#chapter-7.-problem-problems)
> will help you understand the costs, benefits, and complications of
> transitioning to the technique and help you understand the kinds of
> things that go on between a pair of programmers who work together.
>
> In the words of Tom DeMarco, \"An individual can only succeed to the
> extent that the whole prospers. And the whole can only prosper to the
> extent that everyone does well (DeMarco 1995).\" The knowledge we
> share in this section will help you understand how pairing can help
> your \"whole\" prosper and to get stated with that culture change.

### To Pair...

> Pair programming is a style of programming in which *two* programmers
> work side by side at one computer, continually collaborating on the
> same design, algorithm, code, or test. One of the pair, called the
> *driver*, is typing at the computer or writing down a design. The
> other partner, called the *navigator*, has many jobs, one of which is
> to observe the work of the driver, looking for tactical and strategic
> defects. Tactical defects are syntax errors, typos, calling the wrong
> method, and so on. Strategic defects occur when the driver is headed
> down the wrong path---what is implemented just won\'t accomplish what
> needs to be accomplished. The navigator is the strategic, long-range
> thinker. Any of us can be guilty of straying off the path, but a
> simple, \"Can you explain what you\'re doing?\" from the navigator can
> bring us back to earth. The navigator has a much more objective point
> of view and can better think strategically about the direction of the
> work. Another great thing is that the driver and the navigator can
> brainstorm on-demand at any time. An effective pair programming
> relationship is very active. The driver and the navigator communicate,
> if only through guttural utterances (as in, \"Huh?\"), at least every
> 45 to 60 seconds. It\'s also very important to switch roles
> periodically between the driver and the navigator.
>

### ...or Not to Pair, This Is the Question

> Now that you know about pair programming, you might be wondering why
> on earth someone would want to pair. We\'ll be telling you much more
> about these reasons throughout the book, but now we will give you a
> preview of the benefits of pair programming that we\'ve seen,
> experienced, and heard about.

1.  **Quality.** Pairs produce code with fewer defects.

2.  **Time.** As best we can tell, pairs produce higher-quality code in
    > about half the time as individuals. This shortens your cycle time
    > without impacting your overall budget while giving you superior
    > quality. (We\'ll examine this benefit in detail in [Chapter
    > 4](#chapter-4.-overcoming-management-resistance-to-pair-programming).)

3.  **Morale.** Pair programmers are happier programmers. This helps job
    > retention because employees who are having fun are less likely to
    > leave.

4.  **Trust and Teamwork.** Pair programmers get to know their teammates
    
    > much better, which builds trust and improves teamwork.
    
5.  **Knowledge Transfer.** Pair programmers, particularly those who
    > don\'t pair with the same person all the time, know more about the
    > overall system.

6.  **Enhanced learning.** Pairs continoually learn by watching how
    > their partners approach a task, how they use language
    > capabilities, and how they use the development tools.

> These benefits apply not only to new code development, but
> overwhelmingly to code maintenance/enhancement too.
>

### A Fly on the Wall

> So, what\'s it like? To help you envision a development team that
> practices pair programming, let\'s be a fly on the wall one morning
> when a team of developers is getting started. This team practices pair
> programming and pair rotation (explained in depth in [Chapter
> 9](#chapter-9.-pair-rotation-communication-knowledge-management-and-training)).
> With pair rotation, the makeup of each pair is very dynamic and
> depends on the specific tasks that need be done that day (or that
> week, perhaps). This team begins each day with a short meeting.
> Everyone stands during these meetings to emphasize just how short the
> meeting should be. Going around the circle, each person explains what
> he or she accomplished the day before, if there is anything causing
> problems, and what needs to be accomplished today. In the XP
> methodology, these meetings are called \"stand-up meetings\" (Auer and
> Miller 2002). In the SCRUM methodology, these are called \"SCRUM
> meetings\" (Beedle and Schwaber 2002). These short meetings are
> excellent for team building and communication as well as to determine
> who will pair with whom for the day, the morning, or the afternoon.
>
> This following team consists of six developers working on an
> e-commerce application. As the scene begins, five of them are standing
> in a circle. Conspicuously, there is a speakerphone on a table near
> the circle because one team member, Chris, is working from home today.
> Let\'s see how it\'s going as Kimberly, Chris, Brian, Chelsea, Alex,
> and Julie get started this morning.
>
> Kimberly: Yesterday, Chelsea and I worked on the new account entry
> form. We finished the form, but now we have some concerns that some of
> the entries we have on the form might violate our privacy policy.
>
> Julie (*interrupting*): Kimberly, I can work with you this morning to
> resolve the privacy concerns you have.
>
> Kimberly (*finishing*): That would be awesome, Julie. We could
> probably finish it up in just a couple of hours this morning. Anyway,
> Chelsea and I finished the form and the database design to save the
> data in. Chelsea, maybe this afternoon you and I can make the
>
> data-based changes based on the changes that Julie and I come up with
> this morning.
>
> Chelsea: That\'s fine. I guess I\'ll go next then. As Kimberly said,
> she and I did the new account-entry form and the backend database
> yesterday. This afternoon, she and I will make the changes to these
> based on Julie\'s review of any privacy concerns. That leaves me open
> to work with someone this morning. I\'d like to start working on the
> JavaScript to verify this form.
>
> Alex: Brian and I just did that for the shopping cart yesterday. I\'ll
> be fine helping you with that this morning. Julie, then maybe you can
> work with me on privacy problems with the shopping cart this
> afternoon.
>
> Chris (*from the speakerphone*): Sorry, my car didn\'t start this
> morning. Good thing I have AAA. The tow truck just picked it up.
> Anyway, yesterday, I worked with Julie on the privacy policy. You sure
> know the laws, and you sure know how to protect our customers (and
> make sure they don\'t sue our pants off). No offense, Julie, but,
> geez, everyone in the world\'s
>
> not a lawyer. Real people are supposed to be able to read those
> policies! So, anyway, Julie and I finished our privacy policy page.
> Now real people can read it, and the page matches the style of the
> rest of our site. We sent it off to BBBOnLine for review yesterday
> afternoon. They should be back to us next Monday. While I\'m home,
> I\'d like to work with Brian to overhaul the FAQ page today. Can we
> work on that in a NetMeeting session, Brian?
>
> Brian: Sure. Like Alex said, he and I worked on form validation for
> the shopping cart yesterday. Today I guess I\'ll work with Chris to
> overhaul the FAQ page. Guess it doesn\'t live up to your style
> standards, eh, Chris? *(laughing)*
>
> Chris *(laughing)*: No, not quite. Guess we should have paired the
> first time you developed that!
>
> *End of meeting.*
>
> Now, the right people are pairing on the right tasks to get the job
> done, that is, the job of finishing the entire application (not each
> person\'s tasks). Everyone disbands to his or her pairing
> workstations. Brian fires up NetMeeting to work with Chris remotely.
> (We\'ll discuss remote pairing further in [Chapter
> 26](#chapter-26.-moving-ahead-going-beyond).) Our fly flies to
> the top of Alex and Chelsea\'s monitor. It\'s a nice large LCD so they
> can both easily see what\'s going on. Alex and Chelsea are talking
> about the form validation for the new account form.
>
> Chelsea: OK, so we need to validate this form to make sure we send
> good data onto the database. The first two fields of the form are
> LastName and FirstName. To be honest, I haven\'t done this before.
> I\'m thinking that we need to make sure that the user enters letters,
> not numbers or special characters---no spaces either. Actually, Alex,
> let\'s brainstorm a list of all the stupid things that users can do,
> and then we\'ll write the functions for each of them.
>
> Alex: Brian and I did that very same thing yesterday when we did the
> validation for the shopping cart. Actually, just let me get over to
> that directory, and I\'ll find out the name of the file we have all
> those functions in. Then you can just include that file *(grabs
> keyboard)*. Here it is. See, we\'ve defined isWhitespace, isDigit,
> isLetter, checkString, and a whole
>
> bunch of other functions you\'ll need for other parts of the form.
> Chelsea *(singing, taking keyboard back)*:Oh, yeah! Oh yeah! Chelsea
> *(typing)*:

#### \<script language=\"javaScript\"\>

> function validateForm () {
>
> Alex: It\'s probably better if you validate each field separately
> instead of validating the whole form at one time.
>
> Chelsea: Well, I thought I could just make one function to validate
> the whole form, and that function would call a bunch of functions to
> validate each field. After all, none of the validation takes place
> until the user hits the \"submit\" button for the whole form anyway.
>
> Alex: Yeah, I guess you\'re right.
>
> Chelsea *(typing)*: if (checkStrings(lastName)) then
>
> Alex: Actually that function is called checkString,
> notcheckStrings---there\'s no *s* at the end.
>
> Chelsea: Thanks. Good catch.
>
> Alex and Chelsea\'s session continues along these lines. There\'s
> sharing of whole files (saving hours or days of work), questioning,
> suggesting, and brain-storming. Without a doubt, by the end of their
> session, that form will be more correct and more \"idiot proof\" than
> if Alex or Chelsea had worked alone. Between the two of them, Alex and
> Chelsea can think through any mistake that any idiot, er, user could
> possibly make!

### Some Words of Caution

> We use the word *programming* to include all phases of the development
> process (design, debugging, testing, and so on), not just coding. So,
> pair programming would include pair design, pair debugging, pair
> testing, and so on. In fact, two studies have indicated that pairing
> is most important for analysis and design (Williams et al. 2000, Allen
> 2001). We believe people should pair at any time during development,
> in particular when they are working on something that is complex. The
> more complex the task, the greater the need for two brains.
>
> One last word of caution before we launch into the book: We really
> believe that no one should be forced to pair program. We\'ve seen that
> most people resist transitioning to pair programming---it involves
> breaking old habits and being more communicative and collaborative
> than we\'ve been conditioned to be. But among those who try it, almost
> every single person decides it is better than working alone. We know
> that there are people out there who would quit their jobs if they were
> forced to pair. We prefer to think of pair programming as one of those
> pyramid marketing growth plans...let those who are overly enthusiastic
> pair first. They\'ll tell their friends how great it is, and their
> friends will want to try. These friends will tell their friends
> and...you know how it goes.
>
> Ultimately, pair programming is not for all. Solo programmers can
> always contribute to our teams.

### Chapter 2. The Seven Myths of Pair Programming

> Often people who have not tried pair programming are hesitant to start
> or to encourage others to start. Resistance to transitioning to pair
> programming comes from both the top down (from management) and from
> the bottom up (from engineers). It\'s hard to foster support for a new
> practice with resistance coming from both sides! Often, though, the
> resistance comes from misconceptions from those who have never tried
> it, based on reasonable and rational, but incorrect, assumptions.
>
> In this chapter, we will go through these common misconceptions that
> we\'ve heard about concerning pair programming. We\'ll also dig deeper
> into most of these myths in coming chapters.
>

### Myth 1: It will double the workload with two doing the work one can do.

> Managers say, \"Pair programming increases the cost of development. We
> can\'t afford that!\"
>
> Software engineers say, \"When I signed up to do my tasks, I didn\'t
> leave extra time for helping other people do their work.\"
>
> We became interested in pair programming after hearing Extreme
> Programmers\' wonderful stories of success with the technique. Prior
> to the publication of *Extreme Programming Explained* (Beck 2000),
> XP\'s first book, Ward Cunningham\'s *Portland Pattern Repository* was
> the prime communication vehicle for the definition of the XP
> methodology. On Ward\'s Wiki we read, \"Get two people programming in
> pairs, and they\'ll work more than twice as fast as one could have\"
> (Wiki 1999, contributed by Paul Chisholm). We also read, \"One of the
> rules of the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation team is that all
> production code be written with a partner. As a testimonial, in the
> last six months before launching, the only code that caused problems
> was code written solo\" (Wiki 1999, contributed by Kent Beck). Could
> that be true? If it is true, then the concerns of the manager and the
> software engineers mentioned earlier disappear. In addition to being
> academics, we both have been heavily involved in commercial software
> development, and so we could sympathize with the concerns. We were
> intrigued; we wanted to know if it was really true.
>
> To validate the anecdotal claims we were hearing, we ran a formal
> experiment with 41 students writing four programs over a 16-week
> semester at the University of Utah. When these solo and pair
> programmers \"competed\" head-to-head, the pair programmers finished
> in about half the time as solo programmers, and there were fewer
> defects.
>
> For many, this myth alone is a stopper. If this is the case with you,
> we encourage you to flip to [Chapter
> 4](#chapter-4.-overcoming-management-resistance-to-pair-programming)
> for a full discussion on the economics of pair programming.

### Myth 2: I\'ll never get to work alone. I couldn\'t stand that!

> Extreme Programmers (XPers) believe in pair programming so much that
> any production code done alone needs to be redone with a partner. Many
> practicing pair programmers take a more moderate approach to pair
> programming. We ran a survey that was advertised on pair programming
> and XP mailing lists. We also sent personal invitations to participate
> to every pair programmer we could think of. Only 22 percent of those
> who took the survey said they spent 75 percent or more of their day
> pair programming. A full 30 percent said they spend less than half
> their day pair programming. Pair programmers generally do work alone
> for a certain period each day. These survey results are consistent
> with developers in general. In *Peopleware* (DeMarco and Lister 1987),
> it was reported that software developers generally spend 30 percent of
> their time working alone, 50 percent of their time working with one
> other person, and 20 percent of their time working with two or more
> people. So, historically, developers have collaborated, and pair
> programming puts some structure around this collaboration.
>
> Pair programming is very intense---too intense for many to do all day
> every day---and there are schedule constraints to deal with---flex
> hours, sick partners, meetings, and so on. The advice we give is this:
> If you don\'t want to work together at all times, work together on the
> most complex tasks. Have designated \"pair programming hours\" in the
> morning and/or afternoon. At that time, everyone pairs, and no one
> interrupts.
>
> During other hours, work on less complex tasks, go to meetings, and
> return all the phone calls and e-mails you\'ve been avoiding.
>
> Besides that, you might actually find that you can stand to work with
> someone else often. In \"The Danger of Coding Alone\" in *Extreme
> Programming Applied* (Auer and Miller 2002), Ken Auer describes when
> he lost quite a few minutes because he deleted what he believed was
> \"superfluous\" code while his partner stepped away. (Fortunately
> there was a test case that revealed the problem.) Actually many pair
> programmers do report that they really do feel somewhat uncomfortable
> working alone once they are conditioned to working with a partner.
> However, situations like a sick, busy, or vacationing teammate will
> make solo programming necessary. We\'ve done it before; we can do it
> again.
>

### Myth 3: It will work well *only* with the right partner.

> Actually, what we have found is that it will work well with most
> (admittedly, not all) partners. There seems to be one kind of person
> that everyone has trouble working with---somone with excess ego and/or
> a \"my way or the highway\" attitude. Other than that, people are able
> to work with almost anyone. One exception might be pairing an expert
> with a novice. The expert needs to be willing to take on the mentor
> role---for the good of the long term team performance---knowing that
> his or her own productivity will be impacted. If an expert does not
> have these nurturing instincts, it is best not to pair him or her with
> a novice, as we\'ll discuss in [Chapter
> 14](#chapter-14.-expert-novice-pairing).
>
> We\'ll be explaining more about pair rotation in [Chapter
> 9](#chapter-9.-pair-rotation-communication-knowledge-management-and-training).
> For now, we\'ll say that with pair rotation, people pair with
> different people all the time. Of those we surveyed, 83 percent said
> they rotate their pairs. We\'ve heard of groups that practice pair
> rotation with their pairs sticking together for as short as a few
> hours to as long as a few weeks. However, you don\'t have to imagine
> spending the rest of the project shoulder-to-shoulder with one
> individual. In most cases, people who spend lots of time together
> (even married couples) can get on each other\'s nerves. It really
> helps to know that if you can just make it until (specify day/time),
> you won\'t have to work with that person again for awhile.
>

### Myth 4: Pair programming is good for training. But, once you know what you\'re doing, it is a waste of time.

> There is certainly benefit to the apprentice relationship that can
> take place between a new person and an experienced person. However,
> pair programming is mutually beneficial to experienced programmers
> too.

### Myth 5: I\'ll never get credit for doing anything. I\'ll have to share all the recognition with my partner.

> Recognition gets a bit more complicated when pair programming and pair
> rotation enter the picture. No longer can you say, \"Didn\'t Kimberly
> do an excellent job on the storage manager?\" Kimberly had help!
>
> We\'ll approach this myth from two angles. First, things work best if
> each task has an owner. For example, let\'s say that Kimberly owns the
> storage man-ager and Christopher owns the heap. The owner \"recruits\"
> a partner to work with on various parts of the task. It works best if
> the partner has some related knowledge he or she can bring to the
> task. For example, when Kimberly is doing the part of the storage
> manager that interacts with the heap, it would be great if Christopher
> would work with her. He brings related knowledge to the table and
> leaves with knowledge about the storage manager. Ultimately, Kimberly
> can still feel great about her storage manger---partly because she
> recruited the right teammate to pair with her on the right task (a
> skill in itself).
>
> But with pairing, much of our time is now spent on tasks we don\'t
> own. How can we feel good about that? How can Christopher get
> satisfaction from helping Kimberly with her storage manager? First, we
> need to transition to getting more satisfaction from our team
> succeeding. As with any team, including any sports team, individual
> success means nothing without team success. We need to realize that we
> are personally gaining from understanding the overall system much
> better, which helps us do our own tasks better too.
>
> Having said all this, we recommend that some form of peer evaluation
> scheme be developed. Peer evaluation can provide valuable feedback to
> the manager on how helpful the engineers are as partners so the
> manager has a better idea of whom to reward. Periodically engineers
> should write a short statement about those team members they have
> paired with and how effectively they feel the pairing has gone. This
> will be discussed further in [Chapter
> 10](#chapter-10.-other-issues-to-consider).

### Myth 6: The navigator finds only syntax mistakes. How boring is that! Compilers can do that better than humans can anyway.

> True, a major benefit of pair programming is the continual code
> review; the navigator can find syntax mistakes as they are created
> (although we strongly encourage you to give drivers more than a
> handful of nanoseconds to fix their own syntax mistakes). However, the
> job of the navigator is much more important and exciting than this.
> The navigator is holding the roadmap and is guiding the driver to the
> desired destination. Sometimes drivers can get so caught up with
> staying between the lines on a winding road (especially on a snowy
> night), they forget where they are headed. The navigator can\'t go to
> sleep, or the driver might end up lost or worse---he might arrive
> safely at the wrong destination.
>
> Effective pairing relationships involve two very alert participants.
> They brainstorm and discuss approaches continuoually, and, sometimes
> they find syntax mistakes in the process.
>

### Myth 7: The only time I ever get any real work done is when I\'m alone. Now, I\'ll never get anything done! Pair programming would drive me crazy.

> In *Peopleware*, DeMarco and Lister (1987) describe mental flow:
>
> Flow is a condition of deep, nearly meditative involvement. In this
> state, there is a gentle sense of euphoria, and one is largely unaware
> of the passage of time.... There is no consciousness of effort; the
> work just seems to, well, flow.... Not all work roles require that you
> attain a state of flow in order to be productive, but for anyone
> involved in engineering, design, development, writing, or similar
> tasks, flow is a must. These are high-momentum tasks. It\'s only when
> you\'re in a flow that work goes well.
>
> DeMarco and Lister then explain that it takes at least 15 minutes of
> concentration to slowly \"descend\" to flow.
>
> They say, however, that you can be knocked out of flow by any
> interruption, such as a phone call or that ever-present e-mail ding.
> Every time you are interrupted, it takes another 15 minutes to get
> back into flow.
>
> People who have never pair programmed worry that they will never reach
> this euphoric flow state when working with another who, for example,
> just won\'t stop talking and whose job it is, in fact, to talk.
> However, many of those who have tried pair programming have
> experienced the \"two heads are better than one\" version of mental
> flow. The two operate as one intelligent organism and share an
> enhanced, joint flow. Together they explore more possibilities and
> revel in their joint successes. They know from minute to minute that
> they are achieving more together than they ever could alone, and this
> knowledge drives them deeper and deeper into flow. Pairs can also
> prevent each other from flowing down the wrong river by productively
> producing the wrong thing or low-quality code.
>
> When pairs work together, they do a much better job at deferring
> interruptions. They forward their phone to voicemail, they turn off
> their e-mail notification, and they don\'t take \"surf the Web\"
> breaks. When other people walk by and see them working, they often
> choose not to interrupt. Actually pairs also report that if they are
> jointly in the flow state and one of the pair is interrupted, the
> interrupted partner can quickly rejoin the flow of the partner who
> continued---without DeMarco and Lister\'s 15-minute \"descent\" time.
> At the end of a session, they return to the real world and handle all
> the voice-mails, e-mail, and so on.
>
> The opposite of mental flow is mental block (or distraction). Pair
> programming reduces this obstruction either because the pairs keep
> each other on track (and are not distracted) or because one of the
> pair is able to break through the mental block. Often, either one of
> the pair can at least start any task, no matter how impossible it
> seems initially.
>
> As we\'ll discuss in [Chapter
> 4](#chapter-4.-overcoming-management-resistance-to-pair-programming),
> almost all (well over 90 percent of those surveyed) say that they
> enjoy programming more and feel more confident in their work when they

> tend to happen \"naturally\" with pairs, as opposed to the habits of
> effective pair programmers in [Chapter
> 27](#chapter-27.-seven-habits-of-effective-pair-programmers),
> which can take practice and concerted effort. Working together

>
> In fact, we could add an eighth behavior, *pair fun*. In our recent
> Web survey, we asked, \"What have you found beneficial about pair
> programming?\" The single most common response was, \"It\'s a lot more
> fun!\"
>

### Behavior 1: Pair Pressure

> Pair programmers put a positive form of pressure on each other. This
> pair pressure causes us to react in several ways.

##### Programmers admit to working harder and smarter on programs because they do not want to let their partner down.

> We\'ll illustrate this phenomenon by comparing two scenarios.
>
> *Scenario One:* Last night, for example, North Carolina State played
> the University of North Carolina in a basketball game. Your neighbor,
> who has center-court tickets only ten rows from the floor, took you to
> the game. In overtime, North Carolina State (your team, and the
> underdog) comes out on top; it was a nail biter! There\'s one small
> problem, though: after a couple of victory beverages, you don\'t get
> home until well after midnight, and you have to get up at the crack of
> dawn to take your son to swim practice before school. You get to work
> and chat at the coffee machine a bit too long (razzing your UNC
> colleagues about the game, of course). When you finally make it to
> your desk, lack of sleep sets in. After several minutes of staring
> blankly at your screen, you decide to find out if it\'s going to rain
> on Saturday, you just have to send e-mails to all the rest of the UNC
> fans you know. You hit \"send\" on that one final note and then stare
> at the screen for a few more minutes. Just as you\'re starting up
> Visual Age, the phone rings. Happy Day! It\'s your college buddy,
> Danny, calling to plan your houseboat vacation on Lake Powell in
> southern Utah.
>
> *Scenario Two*: Last night, your best friend just announced he got
> engaged. He\'s the first one \"to go.\" You know your girlfriend will
> start looking at you funny now, but for tonight...parrrrrrty!
>
> This morning you perform complex analysis on your alarm clock to
> figure out just how many times you could hit the snooze alarm and
> still get to work on time. You slowly walk from the parking lot to the
> building. As you walk down the hallway toward your cube, you see Chris
> walking toward you for your 8:30 pairing session. (He never stops
> smiling, does he?) The two of you are scheduled to finish the print
> spooler before noon. As you unlock your desk, he\'s starting up the
> computer. You strategically position your Big Slurpee of Mountain Dew
> and sit down next to Chris. Let the day begin!
>
> When you\'re working alone, you can (intentionally or unintentionally)
> hide in your cube and waste time on mindless tasks. Simply the
> presence of another can draw us out of our tired, disgruntled mood and
> cause us to get to work. As we\'ll discuss in the next chapter, Laurie
> has compared the results of her students who pair program and those
> who do not. Students who pair perform much more consistently (and
> better) than those who don\'t. We just don\'t want to let the person
> next to us down, or we\'re embarrassed to disappoint him or her or
> look like a slacker.

##### When programmers meet with their partner, they both work very intensively because they are highly motivated to complete the task at hand during the session.

> \"Two people working together in a pair treat their shared time as
> more valuable. They tend to cut phone calls
>
> short; they don\'t check e-mail messages or favorite Web pages; they
> don\'t waste each other\'s time\" (Wiki 1999, contributed by Paul
> Chisholm).
>
> When we work alone, we can meander through the day. We can get
> ourselves into that mental state we call flow when we want; We can
> surf the Web when we want; We go to meetings and to lunch when we
> want.
>
> Things are different when we pair. When we pair, we need to coordinate
> schedules. (This is something that some people don\'t like about pair
> programming.) Your partner, Alex, needs to drop his kids off at school
> before coming in. You prefer to get in early so you can get to the gym
> in the afternoon before the mad rush. That leaves 9--3 as the only
> possible pairing hours, but, then there\'s lunch and a meeting or two.
> So, that leaves only 9--11 and 1--3. That leaves only four hours, and
> you need to have the socket code done by the end of the day. During

> it done. When you work alone, you generally don\'t put such explicit,

> In *Peopleware* (DeMarco and Lister 1987), the authors enumerate the
> \"Environmental Factor\" or E-Factor as:

![](myMediaFolder/abb3bbc9905e78f4f76554ae47d3452a59295c5b.jpg){width="2.43375in"
height="0.42625in"}

> ability to silence their phone and divert their calls and have fewer
> interruptions can be far more productive (as much as eleven times
> faster). It\'s just that with a partner depending on us, we\'re less
> likely to \"cheat.\"

##### With any software development process there is a constant struggle to get the software engineers to follow the prescribed process. A benefit of pair pressure is improved adherence to procedures and standards.

> Due to human nature, pairs put a positive form of pressure on each
> other to follow the prescribed process. Agile processes (Cockburn
> 2002) can have practices that are quite \"lightweight\" and minimal in
> order to maximize a team\'s ability to be responsive. If these minimal
> processes are ignored, things could fall apart. Together, pairs more
> consistently adhere to prescribed practices and, therefore, produce
> with higher quality results (after all, the creators of the process
> include all the practices for a reason). Each partner expects the
>
> other to follow the prescribed development practices and acts as a
> conscience to the other. \"With your partner watching, though, chances
> are that even if you feel like blowing off one of these practices,
> your partner won\'t...the chances of ignoring your commitment to the
> rest of the team is much smaller in pairs then it is when you work
> alone\" (Beck 2000).

### Behavior 2: Pair Negotiation

> Anyone who has closely observed the practices of cognition is struck
> by the fact that the \"mind\" rarely works alone. The intelligences
> revealed through these practices are distributed---across minds,
> persons, and the symbolic and physical environment...Knowledge is
> commonly socially constructed, through collaborative efforts toward
> shared objectives or by dialogues and challenges brought about by
> differences in persons\' perspectives. (Salomon 1993)
>
> The second of the pair programming behaviors we discuss is pair
> negotiation. We use the term *pair negotiation* to describe how two
> pair programmers arrive at the best solution together. Pair
> negotiation is grounded in an area of psychology called *distributed
> cognition*. Specifically, Flor and Hutchins (1991) studied the
> exchanges of two programmers working together on a software
> maintenance task. They correlated specific verbal and nonverbal
> behaviors of the two with known distributed cognition theories. When
> pairing is working at its best,
>
> - Each brings to the pair partnership his or her own set of skills, abilities, and outlook.
> - Both share the same goal for completing the task.
> - They jointly approach a problem, each with a suggested alternative for attacking it.
> - They must \"negotiate\" how to approach the problem jointly. In this negotiation, they evaluate more
> alternatives than either one would have considered alone; a person
> working alone tends to pursue his or her first approach.
> - Together, the pair efficiently
> determines which is the best plan of attack, considering and including
> suggestions from both partners.
> - They \"high five\" each other for
> being so smart and kicking butt on the task. (We must admit we found
> nothing in the distributed cognition literature about this last step,
> but we know it to be true.)
>
> Some people are concerned that the negotiation might lead to \"worst
> of both worlds\" compromises in implementation. Two studies
> investigate whether group decision making is superior to the decisions
> of the more knowledgeable member. Michaelsen et al. (1989) studied 222
> teams involved in 25 organizational behavior courses. First, each
> completed each test individually; then the teams completed the test
> collaboratively. All 222 groups outperformed their average member, and
> 215 groups outperformed their best mem-ber. As a follow-up study,
> Watson et al. (1991), determined that the longer a group works
> together, the better their decision-making effectiveness.
>
> Finally, decision issues fall on a continuum from purely judgmental
> (no correct answers exist) to purely intellective (those that have a
> demonstrably correct answer). Software correctness decisions are
> almost always intellective. Groups will generally form a consensus on
> judgmental decisions and will generally produce the correct answer to
> an intellective issue if any member of the group proposes it
> (Hungerford and Hevner 1997).
>
> Therefore the synergistic effects arising from programming in pairs
> are partly due to one of the pair proposing the \"correct answer\"
> during the work time; this answer might not have been identified if
> one worked alone.
>
> Related to pair negotiation, collaborative teams consistently report
> that together they can evolve solutions to unruly or seemingly
> impossible problems. *Pair brainstorming* is the effect of having two
> people working to resolve a problem together. They share their
> knowledge and energy, chipping steadily away at the problem, evolving
> a solution to the problem. An effective brainstorming technique
> (Morgan 1993) is to encourage people to build upon the ideas of
> others. A subtle difference though, is that the driver might actually
> be working out a design or implementing part of the problem, realizing
> that he or she may ultimately come to a dead end in the problem
> resolution. The navigator, while watching the driver\'s partial design
> or implementation, begins thinking about the next step. When the
> driver hits the dead end, the navigator is often prepared to take over
> and lead the way. Often, the cycle continues until the problem is
> resolved.
>

### Behavior 3: Pair Courage

> Having a partner is a tremendous courage builder. You can say to each
> other, \"Does this look right to you?\" \"Do you think this part needs
> to be refactored?\" Getting affirmation from our partner gives us the
> confidence to do things we might be afraid to do alone or simply might
> avoid and never do. As teachers, we witness this every day. If you
> give students a problem, ask them to solve it during class, and ask
> them for the answer, you\'ll be guaranteed to get a room full of blank
> stares with the same two or three hands raised. Most people will avoid
> sharing their answer because they don\'t want to look stupid if they
> are wrong. If you tell the students to work out the problem with their
> neighbor and then ask for input, nearly every pair will willingly
> share their answer.
>
> When we work with someone else, we can piece together enough knowledge
> to feel confident in what we\'re doing. And, if it looks right to me
> and it looks right to you---guess what---it\'s probably right!
> Strength in numbers!
>
> Pairing also gives us courage to admit when we don\'t know something.
> Developers by themselves tend to be embarrassed when they don\'t know
> something and will try to muddle through on their own rather than ask
> for help from their peers. A study done at the University of Cape Town
> revealed that 42 percent of developers are inclined to work on
> problems alone rather than ask for help. Interestingly enough, the
> more experience a developer has, the more likely he or she is to ask
> for help; novices are less likely to ask for help (Allen 2001). When
> two people don\'t know something, there is a joint realization that it
> is time to seek help from their peers who may have experience in the
> problem area.
>

### Behavior 4: Pair Reviews

> Inspections were introduced more than 20 years ago as a cost-effective
> means of detecting and removing defects from software. Results from
> empirical studies (Fagan 1976) consistently profess the effectiveness
> of reviews. However, most programmers do not find inspections
> enjoyable or satisfying. As a result, inspections are often not done
> if not mandated, and many inspections are held with unprepared
> inspectors. For example, an informal USENET survey conducted at the
> University of Hawaii found that 80 percent of 90 respondents practiced
> inspection irregularly or not at all (Johnson 1998).
>
> The theory on why inspections are effective is based on the prominent
> knowledge that the earlier a defect is found in a product, the cheaper
> it is to fix the defect. With pair programming, this problem
> identification occurs on a minute-by-minute basis. \"The human eye has
> an almost infinite capacity for not seeing what it does not want to
> see....Programmers, if left to their own devices, will ignore the most
> glaring errors in their output---errors that anyone else can see in an
> instant\" (Weinberg 1998). With pair programming, \"four eyeballs are
> better than two,\" and a momentous number of defects are pre-vented,
> removed right from the start. These continual reviews outperform
> traditional, formal reviews in their defect-removal speed.
> Additionally, they eliminate the programmer\'s distaste for reviews
> since the reviews are implicit in what is typically an enjoyable
> pair-programming session.
>

### Behavior 5: Pair Debugging

> Every person has experienced problems that can be resolved simply
> through the act of explaining them to another.
>
> ...\[An\] effective technique is to explain your code to someone else.
> This will often cause you to explain the bug to yourself. Sometimes it
> takes no more than a few sentences, followed by an embarassed, \"Never
> mind; I see what\'s wrong. Sorry to bother you.\" This works
> remarkably well; you can even use nonprogrammers as listeners. One
> university computer center kept a teddy bear near the help desk.
> Students with mysterious bugs were required to explain them to the
> teddy bear before they could speak to a human counselor (Kernighan and
> Pike 1999).
>
> Others have cited the need just to have a cardboard cutout of their
> favorite guru (Wiki 2001) or a rubber duck (Hunt and Thomas 2000).
> When they have a problem, they must explain the problem to the
> cardboard cutout or rubber duck, often finding the flaw in their
> logic.
>
> Doubtless, it is better to have an animate person to debug with than a
> teddy bear, rubber duck, or cardboard guru. A person will ask
> questions and will likely cause you to do the explaining often. The
> questions and answer can lead to great revelations. Don Wells shares
> an experience.
>
> She was working on code I had never seen before on a system I had
> never seen before. She told me she had a dilemma and wanted to pair
> program to debug it. She had been working on it for a long time, and
> it had spoiled her demonstration that morning. She needed to fix the
> obvious flaw and release the code. I was a bit concerned that I
> didn\'t know anything but proceeded, assuming I would be her teddy
> bear. She explained the problem completely to me; no solution
> presented itself. So I began asking questions and formulating
> scenarios with her. We checked each out in turn, and in a few minutes
> we solved the problem and fixed the code. Let some teddy bear try
> that.
>

### Behavior 6: Pair Learning

> Knowledge is constantly being passed between partners, from tool usage
> tips to programming language rules to design and programming idioms.
> The partners take turns being the teacher and the student. Even
> unspoken skills and habits cross partners (Cockburn and Williams
> 2001).
>
> Lave and Wenger (1991) have studied various types of apprenticeship.
> They stress the importance of an apprentice to participate actively,
> to have legitimate work to do, and to work on the periphery, steadily
> moving toward some higher rank. The novice\'s work is initially simple
> and noncritical. Later work is more critical. Lave and Wenger stress
> the importance of the apprentice working within a \"line of sight\" of
> the expert. The beginner explicitly acquires skills from hearing
> and/or seeing the expert. To further this, Alistair Cockburn, whose
> work includes examining practices and patterns that tend to lead
> toward project success or failure, created the \"Expert-in-Earshot\"
> project management pattern. Experts are put in the same workspace as
> novices so that the novices can learn by watching and listening while
> the expert does his or her usual work (Cockburn and Williams 2001). In
> these contexts, pair programming is a much improved apprenticeship
> situation than a more traditional situation whereby a novice sits in
> his or her own workspace, working on simple code, while the expert
> creates complex code elsewhere.
>
> The continuous reviews of collaborative programming create a unique
> educational capability because the pairs are endlessly learning from
> each other. \"The process of analyzing and critiquing software
> artifacts produced by others is a potent method for learning about
> languages, application domains, and so forth\" (Johnson 1998). The
> learning that transcends these continual reviews prevents future
> defects from occurring---and defect prevention is more efficient than
> any form of defect removal. The continual reviews of collaborative
> programming, in which both partners ceaselessly work to identify and
> resolve problems, affords both optimum defect-removal efficiency and
> the development of defect-prevention skills.
>
> We\'ll talk more about pairs swapping with other pairs in [Chapter
> 9](#chapter-9.-pair-rotation-communication-knowledge-management-and-training),
> but for now we\'ll say that when pairs move around and everyone gets
> to work with everyone else, even more learning occurs, and it occurs
> at a higher pace. Kent Beck (2000) describes this: \"When an important
> new bit of information is learned by someone on the team, it is like
> putting a drop of dye in the water. Because of the pairs switching
> around all the time, the information rapidly diffuses throughout the
> team just as the dye spreads throughout the pool. Unlike the dye,
> however, the information becomes richer and more intense as it spreads
> and is enriched by the experience and insight of everyone on the
> team.\"
>
> If you are interested in the pair learning that can take place among
> students learning a programming language, read [Appendix
> C](#appendix-c.-pair-programming-in-the-classroom).
>

### Behavior 7: Pair Trust

> Pairs must also trust each other. Those who program in pairs are
> developing for the good of the company, not just for themselves.
> Pairing allows them to open up to other people\'s knowledge and
> experience and to see that the end result is far better than anything
> they could have developed on their own. This in turn allows them to
> present their best ideas in a more open environment. If the makeup of
> the pairs is dynamic, developers get to know and trust all (or many)
> on their team. The trust that develops throughout the team is highly
> beneficial for the team itself.
>
> These seven behaviors synergistically work together, allowing 2 > 1 + 1.
> The results of the two together are greater than the results of
> each individually. And, as we said, the overwhelming sentiment is that
> it\'s a lot more fun!

### Chapter 4. Overcoming Management Resistance to Pair Programming

> Software development managers often have the knee-jerk reaction \"Why
> in the world would I pay two programmers to do something that one
> programmer could do?\" This is not a surprising reaction.
>
> In this chapter, we\'re talking to two distinct audiences. First,
> we\'re talking to programmers who would really like to get their team
> into pair programming. We\'ll give you some \"ammunition\" as you
> appeal to your manager\'s motivations. Second, we\'re talking to the
> managers who are trying to decide whether to give it a go. We aim to
> give you some data that you can use in making that decision.
>
> There are also two levels of pair programming: One is a very casual,
> noninvasive use of the practice. You and your peer work together a
> lot, and you both manage to get your job done. You seek out someone to
> work with you when you have something difficult to do. You offer to
> help your peers when they have a tough time. We\'re not going to
> address this casual use of pair programming in this chapter.
>
> Rather, we\'re addressing the prevalent use of pair programming
> throughout a team, where pairing is an integral part of the team
> dynamics and the team development practices---the kind of use that a
> manager would generally be aware of. Hopefully, the manager strives to
> have an \"I don\'t care how you do it, just do it\" attitude. But, we
> know that at the end of the day each manager has a set of objectives
> that needs to be met so the manager can be rela-tively assured of
> being able to feed his or her family. Managers need to know that
> pairing will help them achieve their objectives.
>
> You might be concerned that no matter what we say, it will double the
> amount of time you spend on a task, and you can\'t afford that risk.
> To you, our recommendation is to have a very small, minimal-risk
> pilot. Laurie was working with a development team at IBM. She had
> already told them much of what is included in this chapter. Then she
> had a meeting with the manager and six of the employees in the
> department who were interested in trying pair programming. When it
> really came down to getting started, all were nervous. She encouraged
> them to pick only two from among them to pair program for only one
> week. They would treat this as a pilot and see how it went.
>
> This was a minimal-risk pilot that couldn\'t set a schedule too far
> back, one person-week at most. By the second day of the pilot, they
> e-mailed, \"It\'s incredible how much we\'re teaching each other about
> our areas of the project.\" At the end of the week, they had completed
> a task they estimated at 90 hours in only 60 hours, so they did it in
> less, not more, time by pairing. This module went on to test with only
> two reported test defects---one of them occurred during the 10 hours
> that one of the pair worked alone. One of the programmers commented on
> the defects, \"They could have been caught by \[partner\] and me
> during our initial design, code, and debugging, but they weren\'t
> because of our inexperience with the function we were providing. They
> could have been caught by the formal code review we had and fixed
> before testing found them, but they weren\'t. No one at the code
> review asked questions about the areas of the code where the defects
> occurred.\"
>
> Pilot experiences like these can give a team more confidence in trying
> pair programming on a larger scale.
>

### Motivations

> When she worked at IBM, Laurie used to teach a class called
> \"Increasing Human Effectiveness.\" (The Edge Learning Institute
> developed the course.) Throughout the course, we learned that whenever
> you set a goal, you should also write down \"What\'s In It For Me\"
> (WIIFM). The only way you\'ll change your behavior to reach your goal
> is if there\'s something in it for you, something you personally gain
> by changing the behavior. So we consider the goals of you and/or your
> manager to appeal to the WIIFM thoughts. What are those goals?

1.  I want to complete my projects on time with high-quality code.
2.  I want to reduce my risk of losing a key person.
3.  I want my employees to be happy.
4.  I want to reduce the amount of time it takes to train a new person.
5.  I want my teams to work well together and to communicate more effectively and efficiently with each other.

> Throughout the rest of the chapter, we\'ll explain our findings in
> each of these areas. Some of our results are quantitative and some are
> qualitative.

### Goal: I want to complete my projects on time with high-quality code.

> WIIFM: My bosses are happier because our business objectives are met
> or exceeded and because we have improved customer satisfaction.
>
> We need to build the case that the use of pair programming can help
> managers complete their projects on time and with high quality, a case
> that says that pair programming is economical. Here are some findings.
>
> In 1996, there was a report from Hill Air Force Base:
>
> The two-person team approach places two engineers or two programmers
> in the same location (office, cubicle, etc.) with one workstation and
> one problem to solve. The team is not allowed to divide the task but
> produces the design, code, and documentation as if the team was a
> single individual.... Final project results were outstanding. Total
> productivity was 175 lines per person-month (lppm) compared to a
> documented average individual productivity of only 77 lppm. This
> result is especially striking when we consider two persons produced
> each line of source code. The error rate through software-system
> integration was three orders of magnitude lower than the
> organization\'s norm. Was the project a fluke? No. Why were the
> results so impressive? A brief list of observed phenomena includes
> focused energy, brainstorming, problem solving, continuous design and
> code walkthroughs,
>
> mentoring, and motivation. (Jensen 1996)
>
> In 1998, Temple University Professor Nosek reported on his study of 15
> full-time, experienced programmers working for 45 minutes on a
> challenging problem, important to their organization, in their own
> environment and with their own equipment. Five worked individually;
> ten worked collaboratively in five pairs. Conditions and materials
> used were the same for both the experimental (team) and control
> (individual) groups. This study provided statistically significant
> results, using a two-sided t-test. \"To the surprise of the managers
> and participants, all the teams outperformed the individual
> programmers, enjoyed the problem-solving process more, and had greater
> confidence in their solutions.\" Combining their time, the pairs spent
> 60 percent more time on the task. However, because they worked in
> tandem, they were able to complete the task in less
>
> \"wall-clock\" time, in addition to producing better algorithms and
> code in less time. The majority of the programmers were initially
> skeptical of the value of collaboration in working on the same problem
> and thought it would not be an enjoyable process. However, results
> show collaboration improved both their performance and their enjoyment
> of the problem-solving process (Nosek 1998).
>
> After reading these results, we decided to do an experiment of our
> own, one that ultimately produced groundbreaking results. In 1999 at
> the University of Utah, students in the Senior Software Engineering
> course participated in a structured experiment. The students were
> aware of the importance of the experiment, the need to keep accurate
> information, and the importance of each person (whether in the control
> group or the experimental group) to the outcome. All students attended
> the same classes, received the same instruction, and participated in
> class discussions on the pros and cons of pair programming. When asked
> on the first day of class, 35 of the 41 students (85 percent)
> indicated a preference for pair programming. (Later, many of that 85
> percent admitted they were initially reluctant, but curious, about
> pair programming.) The students also understood that grades would be
> curved in separate pair/individual groupings, so that no one had to be
> concerned that the working arrangement would affect his or her final
> grade.
>
> The students were divided into two groups; both groups were
> deliberately comprised of the same mix of high, average, and low
> performers. Thirteen students formed the control group in which all
> the students worked individually on all assignments. Twenty-eight
> students formed the experimental group in which all worked in
> two-person collaborative teams; collaboratively, they com-pleted the
> same assignments as the individuals. (The collaborative pairs also did
> additional assignments to keep the overall workload the same between
> the two groups.) All 28 students in the experimental group had
> expressed an interest in pair programming, and some of the students in
> the control group had wanted to try pair programming. It is important
> to note that prior to enrolling in this class, students had had
> significant coding practice. Most students had had industry/internship
> experience and had written small compilers, operating system kernels,
> and interpreters in other classes.
>
> Cycle time, productivity, and quality results were compared between
> the two groups. Students recorded information in a Web-based tool
> about the time they spent on each project. Quality was measured by the
> results of automated testing executed by an impartial teaching
> assistant.
>
> As reported (Cockburn and Williams 2000; Williams et al. 2000;
> Williams 2000), our experimental class produced quantitative results
> supporting the pair programming results in industry. The students
> completed four assignments over a period of six weeks. Thirteen
> individuals and fourteen collaborative pairs completed each
> assignment. The pairs passed, on average, 15 percent more of the
> automated postdevelopment test cases (see [Table
> 4-1](#table-4-1.-percentage-of-test-cases-passed)). The
> difference in quality levels is statistically significant.
>
> The pair results were also more consistent, while the individuals
> varied more about the mean. Individuals intermittently didn\'t hand in

> time. This
>
> result can be attributed to \"Pair Pressure\" as discussed in
> [Chapter
> 3](#chapter-3.-the-seven-synergistic-behaviors-of-pair-programming).
> The programmers admitted to working harder and smarter on programs
> because they did not want to let their partner down. Individuals did
> not have this form of pressure and did not perform as consistently.

> With pair programming, the project risk associated with losing this

> with each part of the system. If a pair works together consistently,
> then there are two people familiar with this particular area of the
> program. If the pairs rotate, many people can be familiar with each

### Goal: I want my employees to be happy.

> WIIFM: Undoubtedly, happier employees stay in their jobs longer. Tu
> rnover is very costly in both recruiting and training costs. Also,
> happier, less frustrated people are more positive about their jobs and
> are more eager to help the team meet the objectives.
>
> The incorporation of pair programming has been shown to improve the
> engineers\' job satisfaction and overall confidence while attaining
> the quality and cycle time results discussed earlier. Based on seven
> independent surveys of self-selected pair programmers, over 90 percent
> of pair programmers agreed that they enjoyed their jobs more when pair
> programming. The groups were also surveyed on whether working
> collaboratively made them feel more confident about their work. These
> results are even more positive---96 percent indicated that pair
> programming made them more confident.

### Goal: I want to reduce the amount of time it takes to train a new person.

> WIIFM: My training costs are reduced, which helps me manage my budget.
> New people can actually contribute to projects much earlier.
>
> In *The Mythical Man Month* (1975), Brooks states his law: \"Adding
> manpower to a late software project makes it later.\" He believes that
> communication costs are the major driver leading to this phenomenon.
> Brooks breaks these communication costs into training and
> intercommunication. Certainly, reducing training costs is a worthy
> objective.
>
> Traditionally, people new to an organization are shown different parts
> of a system by senior staff personnel. This dedicated training time
> costs the senior personnel valuable hours. During these hours, neither
> the new person nor the trainer is making contributions toward the
> completion of the project. Through pair programming, the trainer
> teaches by *doing* (not showing), and direct contributions are
> actually made during the training time. Additionally, training seems
> to go much faster, and the new person learns the system more
> intimately.
>
> We\'ll explore the beneftis of pair programming as a training
> technique further in [Chapter 9](#chapter-9.-pair-rotation-communication-knowledge-management-and-training).

### Goal: I want my teams to work well together and to communicate more effectively and efficiently with each other.

> WIIFM: My team works together better because they know each other and
> like each other. This makes them happier employees. It also greatly
> reduces information \"islands\" because people are more likely
> actually to talk to each other more often, sharing problems and
> solutions.
>
> There are many stories of teams that started with pair programming.
> Before pair programming, people would walk into work in the morning at
> different times with a brown-bag lunch in their hands. They\'d walk
> into their office or cubicle, put their lunch down and their
> headphones on. They\'d tap, tap, tap on the keyboard all day. At some
> point, they\'d take their lunch out of the brown bag and eat it. At
> the end of the day, they\'d take off their headphones and head home.
> They would mainly communicate with other team members during meetings
> and via e-mail.
>
> After pair programming, these teams were profoundly transformed.
> Pairing, the team members got to know each other better through the
> idle chitchat that goes on during pauses while pairing. A programmer
> might mention that he was going to a ball game or to her child\'s
> recital that night. The next day, whether they were pairing together,
> one might ask how the recital went or comment on the outcome of the
> game when meeting at the vending machine. As the team gets to know
> each other better, they are far more likely to talk with each other
> about both personal and technical matters. The communication barriers
> between each other start to crumble. Team members find each other much
> more approachable. They will struggle with questions or lack of
> information for less time before getting themselves out of their chair
> and going to ask the right person a question---because now they know
> that person quite well. The rapport and trust built between team
> members gives them the courage to ask each other for advice and
> guidance without feeling vulnerable and insufficient. Additionally,
> they feel better about their jobs because they know their teammates on
> a personal level.
>
> We contend that communication is made more efficient in another
> important way. As we said earlier, Brooks considers training and
> intercommunication costs to be major cost factors. Brooks (1975)
> asserts that \"if each part of the task must be separately coordinated
> with each other part, the \[communication\] effort increases as
> *n*(*n*--1)/2.\" It\'s easy to think about the items that need to be
> done in order to coordinate two interdependent parts: Dependencies
> need to be identified and scheduled accordingly, interfaces need to be
> specified, technical decisions might need to be made jointly, change
> management activities need to be accomplished, and so on.
>
> Additionally, progress might be slowed or completely halted if some
> critical coordination needs to occur when a team member is missing.
>
> Let\'s think about how pair programming can make this communication
> more efficient. Consider first if a team does not rotate pairs but
> assigns larger pieces of functionality to static pairs. Instead of
> breaking the project into *n* parts, the project is broken into
> *n*(/2) parts, and the communication effort increase is reduced
> from*n*(*n*--1)/2 to *n*(*n*--2)/8. When pairs work together, they
> make decisions on dependencies, technical aspects, and interfaces as
> they go. No separate coordination activities need to take place; no
> dependencies and interfaces need special documentation, improving the
> efficiency of team communication. If pairs do rotate, and programmers
> partner with the programmer with whom their task is interdependent, we
> believe this intercommunication cost can be even further reduced
> because needed communication about interfaces and other issues will
> happen during the natural course of pairing.

### Chapter 5. Gaining Support and Acceptance from Your Peers

> You are not a manager, but from what you\'ve heard and what you\'ve
> read, you would like to try pair programming. What do you do now?
>
> Mary Lynn Manns and Linda Rising have done a great deal of research on
> the introduction of new ideas into organizations. In *Introducing
> Patterns into Organizations* (2002), they define a
> pattern[\[1\]](#bookmark45) language and observe the use of
> these patterns in small, medium, and large companies throughout the
> world. The recommendations in this chapter will be made in the context
> of pattern language. Each time we use a pattern from this pattern
> language, it will appear in **boldface**; the names of the patterns
> are quite intuitive.

> 1.  Patterns were inspired by architect
    > Christopher Alexander (Alexander et. al 1977). A pattern is a
    > problem that occurs over and over again in our environment and a
    > description of the core of the solution to that problem. The core
    > of this solution could be used a million times over without ever
    > doing it the same way twice. A pattern language is a collection of
    > patterns that build upon each other to generate a system.

> If you are not a manager and are interested in trying pair programming
> within your organization, then according to Manns and Rising\'s
> pattern language, you are an **Evangelist**. You believe that pair
> programming will be valuable for your organization. You want to give
> it a shot and spread the word.
>
> We suggest gradually introducing a very casual, noninvasive use of the
> practice with your peers. One thing to consider is that, as an
> industry, programmers are overcommitted. You probably are too. So
> launching the grassroots peer acceptance strategy requires a leap of
> faith on your part because you certainly don\'t want to give yourself
> any more work. So we encourage you to use a risk-mitigation strategy
> with yourself as well. Start small; you need to convince yourself that
> it\'s worthwhile before you can convince others. You also don\'t want
> to work a lot of extra overtime because of your casual
> experimentation. By doing this, you **Test the Waters**.
>
> Identify people on your team that seem especially interested in new
> ideas. Consider these folks as targeted **Innovators**. Manns and
> Rising advise, \"\[Innovators\] are quick to see if something is worth
> their time, however, so they won\'t tolerate something half-baked.
> Make sure you\'ve done your homework before enlisting their support.\"
> First, you can try to discuss pair programming nonchalantly with these
> folks over lunch or at the vending machine. Be sure to be prepared
> with a **Personal Touch**---in other words, a specific way that pair
> programming can personally help that person get his or her job done
> better. Rogers (1995) writes, \"The relative advantage of an
> innovation ...is positively related to its rate of adoption.\" One
> dimension of relative advantage is the savings an individual realizes
> in time and effort. Go back and reread [Chapter
> 4](#chapter-4.-overcoming-management-resistance-to-pair-programming).
> Your peers want to finish on time, with higher quality, and have more
> fun, don\'t they?
>
> If you find someone else who is interested, that is wonderful. Quite
> often, programmers can find someone on their team willing to give it a
> try. Just start pairing for small bits of time together; make sure
> that you are both able to keep up with your assigned responsibilities
> so no one gets nervous. If you haven\'t found any receptive
> programmers, we suggest that you just start pairing with people on
> your team in small bits of time. In other words, **Just Do It**. Think
> about the makeup of your team. Who are you already friendly with? Who
> works in
>
> areas that you already understand pretty well? If you can think of a
> programmer or two who meets both of those criteria, they are great
> candidates to get started with.
>
> You might see one of your candidates working. Pull up a chair next to
> him or her. If you\'ve never discussed the subject before or that
> person hasn\'t been particularly receptive to the idea, don\'t say,
> \"Want to try pair programming with me?\" As we have said, many are
> resistant to trying pair programming. If you label what you\'re
> proposing, they might get anxious.
>
> Just say, \"Hey, what are you working on?\" After you get an answer,
> say, \"Could you help me for a bit?\" Quite likely, the person will
> agree to give you some time; helping others boosts one\'s ego and
> reaffirms one\'s confidence. Work together for half an hour to a
> couple of hours, depending on when a natural break point occurs.
> Don\'t be too concerned about following the model of driver and
> navigator. At this point, say, \"I think that went really well. You
> really helped me a lot---thanks. If you ever need help, be sure to
> ask. I\'d be happy to return the favor.\" Repeat this process a few
> more times. We feel quite sure that if you start to try pairing with a
> peer, most often it will work out. If not, don\'t get discouraged; try
> it with someone else. When you feel that you have established a
> mutually beneficial pair programming relationship with someone, you
> should explicitly discuss the experiences with that person and let him
> or her know that what you have been doing is pair programming (if it
> hasn\'t been figured out yet). Assuming the person agrees it was
> beneficial, a pair programming relationship is born!
>
> Once each of you firmly feels that pair programming is helpful, look
> around your team for other candidates to work with for small chunks of
> time. If each of you starts to pair with one other, then four on your
> team are casually experimenting with the technique. In this way, the
> team of **Innovators** will gradually grow to the**Early Majority**.
> Ultimately, this can lead to a**Grass Roots** effort whereby there are
> enough**Innovators** to provide a foundation of pair programming
> within the organization, and the practice can naturally be diffused to
> others.
>
> Assuming that you are all getting your work done on schedule, it\'s
> probably not necessary to get your manager officially involved until
> there is acceptance among a handful or more of the team members. If
> you are satisfied with how things are going and don\'t want to take it

> programmers working together from time to time. However, we encourage
> you always to consider taking it to the next level as time goes on.
> For one thing, pair programming might fizzle over time if pairing and
> the rotation of the pairs are not ingrained into the practices of your
> team. When you ask a peer to help you, you might get a reply too often
> that he or she is busy.

> Once you do feel as if it would be advantageous to spread the practice

### Chapter 6. Transitioning to Pair Programming by Choice

> We start this chapter with a true story about a presentation Laurie
> did to introduce an organization to pair programming. She\'s done
> quite a few of these pair programming presentations and figured she
> knew how the day would go. She hooked her laptop to the projector and
> people started to file in slowly. Usually before a presentation
> officially starts, people casually chat with Laurie about their
> experiences trying pair programming, or they comment on a paper they
> read. Funny thing, though, no one talked to her this day. The vice
> president of software development, Danny (named changed), walked in
> and introduced himself to Laurie and Laurie started the presentation.
> Because she\'d done this presentation many times, she knew when
> questions would start flowing or when people would generally laugh.
> Nothing; There was no reaction at all to what she was saying.
>
> She thought this was kind of odd and started *really* looking at her
> audience\'s faces. They looked like they were at a funeral. It was
> tough to get through the rest of the talk. The only one who asked any
> questions or made any comments was Danny, and oh, yes, there was one
> woman (we\'ll call her Kimberly) in the back of the room, bless her
> heart. She smiled and nodded at Laurie the whole time. Thank goodness
> for Kimberly. After the talk, Laurie did a \"Pair Programming
> Readiness\" survey that she has often done. The survey assesses the
> team\'s perception of how helpful pair programming will be and what
> specific concerns they might have. After taking the survey, the
> employees silently filed out of the room.
>
> After the talk, Laurie met up with Kimberly in the hallway. She was
> still smiling. She said, \"I really, really enjoyed your talk. I am so
> happy you came to talk to us. I can\'t wait to get started pair
> programming.\"
>
> Laurie then met with the man who arranged her trip. He said he was
> going to see who wanted to go to lunch with her, and Laurie should
> wait in the lobby. After what seemed like an hour, he emerged with his
> two best friends (probably the only ones he could arm wrestle into
> coming to lunch). When they sat down for lunch, Laurie popped the
> question: \"Danny is forcing you guys to pair program, isn\'t he?\"
> All of them stared in disbelief that it was so obvious and shook their
> heads to agree. The three then admitted that Danny had read some
> papers Laurie and Bob Kesler had published about pair programming
> (Williams and Kessler 2000; Williams et al. 2000). When he was done
> reading, he said to himself, \"That\'s it! We\'re doing it.\" He asked
> someone who worked for him to contact Laurie and bring her to talk to
> his group. Meanwhile, he made some form of proclamation to his team,
> \"Read these articles. We\'re going to start pair programming. Laurie
> Williams is going to come talk to us about the practice, and then
> we\'ll get started after she leaves.\"
>
> After lunch, Laurie went to the airport and started flipping through

### Green and Hevner\'s Findings

> \"Several promising new tools and techniques have improved software
> development, but most are either not widely adopted or often quickly
> abandoned\" (Green and Hevner 2000). Green and Hevner\'s report
> focuses on why this often happens and how we can prevent it from
> happening. We hope their advice can ease the diffusion of pair
> programming through an organization, particularly when initiated by
> management. We aim for sustained use of pair programming rather than
> abandonment of this new technique.
>
> Green and Hevner developed a research model of diffusion of software
> development techniques. The two researchers developed the research
> model including twelve research hypotheses. Using surveys, they then
> evaluated their model by performing an extensive field study of
> industrial software developers. The model and subsequent field study
> showed that developer involvement in the implementation process and
> the characteristics of the environment into which the techniques are
> introduced are key factors in the diffusion success. Specifically,
> their research demonstrated that developers are more satisfied with
> using software development innovations if
>
> - **they have *increased* choice in when
> to use that innovation.** This suggests that managers should provide
> to individual developers as much freedom as possible to decide when to
> apply innovative software development techniques, such as pair
> programming.
>
> - **they have *decreased* process
> control in how to use that innovation.** The findings of the study
> indicate that in a complex task environment, such as software
> development, decreases in personal control can result in greater
> satisfaction. This was a particularly interesting finding that would
> discourage an \"if you want to pair, go ahead and pair---I don\'t
> care\" arrangement and encourage a more organized approach of pairing
> and possibly the rotation of pairs, still giving the employees the
> freedom to choose when to pair and what to do when they pair. Likewise
> it is not advisable for the manager to say, \"Now that you understand
> the theory of pair programming, I will let each of your teams decide
> how best to practice it.\" This gives the developers too much process
> control leading to confusion on how best to implement the technique
> and the risk of different teams using disparate, and maybe
> conflicting, pair programming techniques. Thus the manager thinks he
> is giving the developers desired flexibility; instead, he is creating
> a confusing environment for practicing the technique. Some level of
> consistent organizational standards and procedures for implementing
> pair programming is essential.
>
> - **their manager encouraged them to use
> the innovative technique.** Again this would discourage an \"if you
> want to pair, go ahead and pair---I don\'t care\" attitude on the part
> of management. The employees need to know their manager is supportive
> of pairing and that \"we pair program in this department.\" To be most
> effective, managers need to find how far they can go with
> encouragement without crossing the \"forcing\" line.
>
> - **the innovation increases the
> predictability of their work.** As we said in[Chapter 4](#chapter-4.-overcoming-management-resistance-to-pair-programming),
> the pairs in the pair programming study at the University of Utah
> performed more consistently and predictably than individuals. Not only
> did they achieve higher scores, but the standard deviation of their
> scores was
> much lower than that of individuals. Pair pressure causes us to \"rise
> to the occasion\" and perform. Therefore, according to these findings,
> programmers should appreciate the added predictability of their
> results while pairing.
>
> The two researchers also support the assertions of Moore and Benbasat
> (1991) that *mandating* the use of a new technique is not good.
> Instead, managers should *encourage* the use of the new technique to

### Advice for Management

> Undoubtedly, Danny\'s technique of mandating pair programming is not
> advisable---his behavior could be a supportive example for Green and
> Hevner. Most often, change cannot be \"managed\" from the top.
>
> Harvard\'s John Kotter, in a study of 100 top management-driven
> \"corporate transformation\" efforts, concluded that more than half
> did not survive the initial phases. He found a few that were \"very
> successful\" and a few that were \"utter failures.\" The vast majority
> lay \"somewhere in between, with a distinct tilt toward the lower end
> of the scale....\" This failure to sustain significant change recurs
> again and again despite substantial resources committed to the change
> effort (many are bankrolled by top management), talented and committed
> people \"driving the change,\" and high stakes. (Senge et al. 1999)
>
> We have some advice for managers who would like to intoduce pair
> programming in their organization. Again, as in [Chapter
> 5](#chapter-5.-gaining-support-and-acceptance-from-your-peers),
> we frame this recommendation in Manns and Rising\'s (2002) pattern
> language for introducing innovation into an organization. Again the
> patterns that we use are in **boldface**. We assume you are the**Local
> Leader,** but in this situation you can also become the**Evangelist**
> by putting your managerial authority second when it comes to the
> diffusion of pair programming.

1.  Ask an open-minded, respected senior programmer, a **Respected
Techie**, to read about pair programming. This person should
actually try the technique several times by wandering into team
member\'s offices. By finding an opportunity to **Just Do It**, he
or she can use the techniques outlined in [Chapter 5](#chapter-5.-gaining-support-and-acceptance-from-your-peers)
for working with others and can also use the pattern when training
new personnel. Do not rush this step. It is very important for the
senior person genuinely to be convinced of the technique through
actual experiences, not just by reading about them. If this person
does not attain this level of appreciation for the technique, ask
him or her not to criticize pair programming publicly; pick
another senior developer. (Remember, we already know that pair
programming is not for all.)

2.  Once a senior developer is genuinely convinced of the technique,
encourage him or her to gain the support of other programmers,
some **Innovators**, by continuing to use the suggestions
in[Chapter 5](#chapter-5.-gaining-support-and-acceptance-from-your-peers).
Additionally, you can ask the senior developer to organize a Pair
Programming Tutorial. [Appendix A](#appendix-a.-pair-programming-tutorial) outlines a
half-day session which can be run with members of the team.

3. Once there is support for the technique among a few developers and
enough **Early Adopters**, it is time for an educational session for a
larger organization. This session should be run by the senior
developer, preferably without any management present. It could be a
**Brown Bag** lunch or a department meeting (**Do Food**). The other
programmers who have tried and like the technique should be encouraged
to share their experiences by discussing a **Hometown Story**.

    The **Early Adopters** should be prepared with a **Personal
Touch**---in other words, a specific way that pair programming can
personally help each person get his or her job done better. Also be
prepared for negative reaction and skeptics (**Fear Less**). It is a
big change, one that many would likely fear before trying. \"In
presentations, bring up the negative things you have heard or
anticipate what your
detractors might say. If you don\'t bring these issues up, you are
more vulnerable when someone else raises them. This approach of
inviting resistance makes sure that all concerns are heard\" (Manns
and Rising 2002).

4.  During this educational session, several things should be accomplished:
    - Programmers who are interested in trying the technique should sign up. Using this information, the team
should develop an informal plan for who should try pairing with whom.
    - The initial trial of the technique should feel low risk for all involved: **Test the Waters**. Most will
still be concerned that, for them, pairing will double their workload.
Initial trials could be in short intervals of one to two hours. Some
organizations have, instead, chosen small groups of volunteers as
their designated experimenters. These developers have paired full time
for four to six weeks and report results back to the larger group.
    - Put in place a system of feeding back concerns and successes of these trials. This system can be as informal
as stopping in the senior programmer\'s office periodically or as
formal as keeping track of progress/ defects. This is the **Evaluation
Phase.**
    - The team should then discuss what would convince them that pair programming is or is not a valid
technique. The team should decide what data they want to collect and
how long it will take for them to decide on the validity of the
technique.
    - The team should discuss organizational guidelines for use of the pair programming and some success criteria.
For example, some organizations have policies such as pairing takes
place between 9:00--11:00 and 1:00--3:00, no meetings should be held
during this time, interruptions of any kind should be avoided.

5. **Involve Everyone.** A strategy for reaching everyone, including
skeptics, is to pair an avi**E**d**arly Adopter** with a skeptic 
**A**( **dopt a Skeptic**).

> Once the official trial has completed, evaluate the results, and
> democratically determine the future of pair programming in your
> organization. If it is to be fairly widespread, you\'ll need to read
> [Part Two](#part-ii-getting-started-with-pair-programming),
> which will help you with some implementation items.
>
> Managers must also have a consistent message for the employees. If
> managers encourage pair programming and then continue to value the
> heroics of individuals, the team will have a very hard time with pair
> programming. Widespread use of pair programming involves a cultural
> shift in the values of the organization---away from individual and
> toward team recognition and goals. The manager must carefully think
> through the implications to his or her own reward structure and to
> that of the larger organization, beyond the team itself.
>
> Never forget: Mandating is bad; structuring, encouraging, and
> supporting are good.

### Advice for Programmers

> Perhaps, unfortunately, you have a manager like Danny. Now what? We
> advise you to hold off on quitting your job; give pair programming a
> fair chance. There are some things about pairing that could really
> help you, if you will just give it a try.
>
> Even if everyone else is saying it, we advise you not to make any
> public statements such as \"If I have to pair program, I\'m
> quitting.\" Once you make a statement like that, it is hard to go back
> on your word and to give pair programming a fair try because you may
> feel like a traitor in the eyes of your \"antipair programming\"
> peers.
>
> Suspend disbelief. Jim and Michele McCarthy (2002) recommend that
> their teamwork training classes *pretend* to have a shared vision.
> Pretend pair programming will work so that you will give it a fair
> shot. All in all, we encourage you not to form an opinion until after
> you have tried pair programming for a couple of weeks. Others have
> found that it could take a couple of weeks and a few horrible pairing
> sessions until they get into the flow of pair programming. If your
> manager sees you giving it a fair try and you still don\'t like it
> after a couple of weeks, he or she should accept the fact that maybe
> you don\'t work better in a pair. The manager needs to appreciate the
> contributions of solo programmers and to be reminded that, in our
> experience, not everyone works best as a pair programmer.

### Dependency

> Once you start to pair, you really grow to like it; it makes you feel
> a bit uneasy to program alone. One of Laurie\'s earliest pair
> programming students said, \"When I program alone, I feel like I lost
> half my brain.\" In *Extreme Programming Applied: Programming to Win*
> (Auer 2001), Ken Auer describes a scenario where a costly error was
> introduced while his partner was in the restroom!
>
> So what do you do if the right partner is not available? Freeze?
> Decide to check your e-mail and surf the Web until he or she is
> available? Of course not! First, consider if there\'s another part of
> the system you can work on in which you can find a partner. Next think

> the end, we\'ve programmed alone before; we can do it again! Just
> proceed a bit more cautiously (since you\'re working alone), and make
> sure to review your work with your partner when you are able to get
> back together.
>

### Scheduling

> Without pairing, scheduling everyone\'s time is easier. \"You do the
> proxy agent and report back here on the 19th.\" Actually, if everyone
> works with the same person all the time, scheduling is not any harder.
> \"You two do the proxy agent and report back here on the 10th.\"
>
> Scheduling becomes more of a conflict if who pairs with whom is
> changed regularly. Every team member will own different aspects of the
> system and will \"recruit\" the right partner depending on what he or
> she is doing. This can create situations where a person might want to
> clone himself or herself (at least once). Who does what when? There
> are many benefits to this pair rotation, so we don\'t want to make the
> scheduling/logistical issues sound insurmountable, but it does need to
> be dealt with. We discuss these benefits and some scheduling
> arrangements in [Chapter 9](#chapter-9.-pair-rotation-communication-knowledge-management-and-training).
>

### The Ever-Popular Expert

> This is a continuation of the scheduling problem. Within the team,
> experts---the GUI expert, the database expert, the kernel
> expert---emerge. Everybody wants to pair with these folks when the
> task \"touches\" the GUI, the database, or the kernel.
>
> Ultimately, the experts and the heroes need to have time to work on
> the tasks they own themselves (the GUI, the database, and the kernel).
> You need to ensure that whatever scheduling algorithm you choose
> allows the expert time to do his or her own thing, using other
> teammates as partners.
>
> An experienced pair programmer shares some advice:
>
> If there is some number of designated pairing periods during the day,
> let the experts spend (for example) at least half on their own tasks.
> On one project, where the experts were in extremely heavy demand, we
> did this the other way around: Experts had designated \"office hours\"
> and could be used as consultants only on that schedule and only by
> \"signing up\" for their time in advance.
>

### Colocation

> Pairing means that partners must be sitting side-by-side, in the same
> location, at the same time. What if Danny and Chris need to pair, but
> Chris likes to get in very early to beat the traffic and Danny gets in
> much later because he has to drive his kids to school? Or perhaps,
> Kimberly\'s gotten used to working from home a few days a week or does
> so whenever her school-age kids are sick? Does introducing pair
> programming mean the freedoms these programmers have come to enjoy are
> taken away? If so, maybe they\'ll find another job that allows them
> these freedoms.
>
> This is a sensitive and tricky issue. The resolution requires balance:
> balance between the needs of the project and the needs of the
> employees. We don\'t have all the answers, but we can offer a few
> ideas. First, to accommodate the freedoms of flex hours, consider
> having reasonable \"core pair programming hours.\" All employees
> should be in work and available for pairing during those hours. During
> the noncore hours, programmers can do things that are typically done
> alone,---like answering e-mails, writing documentation, learning new
> tools, researching new techniques, and so on.
>
> For the \"work from home\" crew or for the growing numbers of
> geographically distributed teams, you can consider distributed pair
> programming. This is becoming increasingly popular. We discuss it more
> in [Chapter](#chapter-26.-moving-ahead-going-beyond)
>
> [26](#chapter-26.-moving-ahead-going-beyond). We won\'t say
> that distributed pair programming is as effective as colocated pair
> programming, but it can be a valid option, particularly when the
> alternative is solo programming.
>

### Noise and Facility Considerations

> Effective pairs chatter; silence is a danger signal for a
> dysfunctional pair. This is not as much of a problem for other pairs
> as it is for the soloists who are trying to work near the pairs.
> Resolving this problem may require a commitment from the organization
> in terms of a facility change or equipment purchase. Pairing can also
> be difficult if cubicles or desks are arranged improperly. Tu rn to
> [Chapter 8](#chapter-8.-workplace-layout) to read about this
> and other facility considerations.
>

### Concentration

> Some people feel that they cannot achieve the same level of
> concentration and creativity when they work with a partner. In the
> November/December 2001 issue of *IEEE Software*, Robert Glass writes:
>
> Many of us prefer to work for a burst of creative time in isolation,
> getting back together with our team when we have pieces of information
> to share and decisions to make. I cannot imagine holding ongoing
> conversations with a pairmate when I am operating in creative mode.
>
> We acknowledge that there are many different personality types and
> modes of working effectively. Laurie\'s advice to Robert (in a letter
> to the editor) and to others who feel this way is to work alone if you
> feel you need to in order to be most creative. Investigate something,
> make a little prototype, but be open to revising your
> brainstormed-in-isolation solution when you get back with your
> partner. Most certainly, your partner can think of something you
> didn\'t think of when you were alone.
>

### Disagreements

> Disagreements happen. Following are some strategies for resolving
> conflicts:
>
> - Each of you go off alone for a
> specified period of time to cool off and to investigate what you feel
> so strongly about. During this time, you might convince yourself that

> - Take a walk around the building---together!

> Most important, have the conviction not to compromise when you believe

### Overconfidence

>
> Detailed testing can lessen the danger of overconfidence.
> See[Appendix D](#appendix-d.-an-introduction-to-test-driven-development) for
> a discussion on testing.
>

### Rushing

> In [Chapter
> 3](#chapter-3.-the-seven-synergistic-behaviors-of-pair-programming),
> we discussed pair pressure and how focused a pair can become in order
> to finish the task at hand before they need to separate. We claimed

> to complete something and do a poor job in the process. If a task must
> roll over to another pairing session, the task must roll over to
> another pairing session! Slow down, and do it right together.
>

### Skill Imbalances

> Skill imbalances can be tough to stomach. A team member should ideally
> realize that bringing up the skill level of a weaker team member is

> Probably more frustrating is a partner with a weaker skill level who

> to be removed from the team.
>
> Working with a partner gives us added confidence that what we are

> requires patience.
>
> Chapters [13](#chapter-13.-expert-average-pairing) and
> [14](#chapter-14.-expert-novice-pairing) give more advice about
> skill imbalances.
>

### Simply Not for All

> As we\'ve said before, not everyone can pair or will want to pair.
> Pairing might not work for someone who is too introverted,
> soft-spoken, or lacks confidence. Perhaps this person can \"grow out\"
> of that with a nonthreatening pairing with a fabulous mentor or with
> another introverted, soft-spoken person. Pairing might also not work
> because someone is too self-centered or too egotistical or because he
> or she feels threatened---threatened to expose weaknesses in his or
> her knowledge or threatened to produce or lose his or her job. If you
> feel like you can\'t pair, do some self-examination to see if you can
> enlarge your comfort zone to include pairing.
>
> We must, however, continue to respect the work of pairs and soloists.
>

### Summary: Maintenance Required

> Casual pairing needs no maintenance. If someone wants help, he or she
> can hopefully recruit someone to pair with for a while. No long-term
> relationship or arrangement is needed.
>
> For more widespread pairing, there needs to be support and
> encouragement from the team coach/leader and the manager lest pairing
> will fade over time. After 20 or more years of studies supporting code
> inspections as an effective and efficient means of defect removal,
> most programmers avoid inspections like the plague. Pair programming
> doesn\'t have 20 years of studies. Programmers might still hang on to
> the belief they can do it faster if they worked alone. This might
> cause them to avoid pairing when they\'re in a time crunch. Collect
> and disseminate information/metrics to the team on the effeciveness of
> pairing. Do spot checks to make sure people are really pairing and are
> pairing effectively. This is a perfect application for Management by
> Walking Around (also commonly known as MBWA). Are people pairing? Are
> the pairs talking to each other? Are the roles of driver and navigator
> being rotated?
>
> ![](myMediaFolder/0dc1e173d04ff3ce0a943f8a9eeda06898235d6d.png)And, as we suggested,
> revised scheduling procedures and facilities will be needed. Carefully
> consider the issues of this chapter. Go into pair programming with
> your eyes open.

# Part II: Getting Started with Pair Programming

> In order to implement pair programming beyond casual use, there are
> some issues to consider. We will discuss them in [Part Two](#part-ii-getting-started-with-pair-programming). In
> [Chapter 8](#chapter-8.-workplace-layout) we discuss some

### Chapter 8. Workplace Layout

> There are some important ergonomic considerations for pair
> programmers. In this chapter we will discuss some basic workplace
> needs to facilitate the sharing between pair programmers. Hopefully
> these needs can be accomplished without spending any money. Then we
> discuss some alternate arrangements, which can further enhance the
> effectiveness and satisfaction of the pairs.
>

### The Basic Needs

> As a bare minimum, the two pair programmers need to be able to sit
> comfortably side by side with a fairly large (17-inch minimum) monitor
> between them. The driver should be sitting squarely in front of the
> keyboard and mouse. The navigator must have a clear view of the
> display. When the driver and navigator switch roles, it should simply
> mean that the keyboard and mouse slide from one person to the other. A
> danger signal is when the two are tempted to get up and swap chairs
> when they switch roles. If this is the case, then the navigator
> probably does not have a decent viewing/contributing position. It is
> far less than ideal for the navigator to be sitting directly behind
> the driver, \"breathing down the driver\'s neck.\"
>
> These basic layout specifications can probably be accomplished in most
> workplaces without any expenditure as long as there are straight
> tables available. We have found that two programmers can comfortably
> sit side by side at a six-by-three foot table. Many report that convex
> tables (with an outer curve) work very well because the programmers
> don\'t need to worry about bumping chairs. Some cubicles are arranged
> so that the computer is located in the corner with cabinets on either
> side. This arrangement would need to be changed for effective pairing;
> very small tables are equally poor.
>
> A programmer would pair with another by \'visiting\' the workplace of
> his or her partner. Code would be accessible to their workstation via
> a network.
>

### Some Suggested Workplace Enhancements

> Experienced pairs have done many things to enhance their workplace
> arrangements. Although these alternatives generally require some
> capital expenditures, we are fortunate today that computers are very
> affordable, making some of thefollowing suggestions feasible.

### Interpair Communications

> Effective communication, both within a pair and with other pairs, is
> paramount. Without much effort, programmers need to see each other,
> ask each other questions, and make decisions on things such as
> integration issues, lest these questions/issues are not discussed
> adequately. Programmers also benefit from \"accidentally\" overhearing
> other conversations to which they can have vital contributions.
> Separate offices and cubicles can inhibit this necessary exchange.
> \"If any one thing proves that psychological research has been ignored
> by working managers, it\'s the continuing use of half partitions to
> divide workspace into cubicles.... Like many kings, some managers use
> divide-and-conquer tactics to rule their subjects, but programmers
> need contact with other programmers\" (Weinberg 1998).

> RoleModel Software, located in Holly Springs, North Carolina, has
> created the eXtreme Programming Software Studio. Their workstation
> layout supports both intra- and interpair communication. Tables are

> One pair sits at each of these six tables; the pair can certainly
> communicate. However, with this layout, pairs can very easily
> communicate and \"overhear\" what is going on with the pairs to either
> side of or across from them. They can also interact with the other
> pairs fairly easily.
>

### Development Environments

> As with keyboard and mouse preferences, many developers have strong
> development environment (Visual SlickEdit, Visual Cafe, VisualAge) and
> debugger preferences. Ideally, there is a standardized environment. If
> not, then forcing one to change his or her environment might be enough
> to turn someone sour on pairing. In XP Applied (Auer and Miller 2002),
> Auer and Miller suggest, \"in order to broaden their horizons, people
> must agree to program in a different environment for at least half the
> time for the next *n* weeks. *n* won\'t have to be too high before
> they decide they can converge on a single environment.\"
>

### Noise Considerations

> We have observed that effective pair programmers communicate with each
> other at least once every minute. Compared to the days when everyone
> worked alone, the workplace will be considerably nosier with pairing.
> Most pairs have said that they are so intent on their work, they can
> easily block out the noise. Some say it takes a few weeks to learn to
> block out the noise, which is another good reason to try pairing for a
> few weeks before making a decision on whether you prefer it over solo
> programming.
>
> Others have a very delicate attention span. These folks may genuinely
> do better working alone in a quiet environment.
>
> Those who work well in pairs can block out the noise of other pairs.
> However, their solo programming neighbors must be considered. There
> needs to be a sufficient barrier between pairing programmers and solo
> programmers to prevent disrupting the solo programmer. Preferably the
> groups should be separated by a door or at least by a tall (72\")
> partition. Alternatively, a white noise machine can be installed to
> mask the murmur of the pairs. Studies have shown (DeMarco and Lister
> 1987) that \[solo\] programmers who worked in a quiet workplace were
> one third more likely to deliver zero-defect work. So, the impact of
> pair noise on solo programmers must be carefully considered.

### Chapter 9. Pair Rotation: Communication, Knowledge Management, and Training

> Let\'s say you have a ten-person software development team, and you
> want to use pair programming. One way of implementing it would be to
> pair everyone and have five pairs that would work together. We believe
> a preferred way of implementing pair programming would be to have the
> pairs switch partners periodically. The advantages of rotating are
> that the programmers learn more about the whole product by pairing
> with different people: they team with the person who can help them the
> most on a particular task, and communication increases significantly.
> Also, you don\'t have to worry as much about pairs becoming
> dysfunctional and the need to switch around all the pairs because two
> particular people just can\'t get along. The two people who don\'t get
> along can probably stand to work together in half-day or full-day
> increments.
>
> In this chapter, we\'ll describe a pair rotation strategy and how many
> companies determine who pairs with whom and for how long. Then we\'ll
> talk about the knowledge management, training, and communication
> advantages of pair rotation.
>

### Pairing with the Right Partner

> When people hear about rotating pairs, they often have the vision that
> this creates lots of jack-of-all-trades, masters-of-none generalists
> and discourages specialization. This section gives a simplified
> example of how to maintain specialists, spread knowledge around the
> team, and still enjoy the other benefits of pair programming. The
> example may seem rigid and prescribed. In actuality, pair rotation
> often occurs very casually without any formal schedule because team
> members learn how to maximize the benefits of pairing by choosing the
> right partner for the right situation. Also note that in a training
> scenario, it is best if the new person rotates around the group a bit,
> pairing with patient, mentoring types within the team, until he or she
> is assigned an area of specialty.
>
> Consider a simple drink vending machine program. This program
> logically divides into four pieces: the GUI, the customer capabilities
> logic, the machine maintenance logic, and the data structures to run
> the whole program. Based on each employee\'s previous experience and
> expertise, he or she is assigned one of the following four pieces:

+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| > **Team Member**                   | > **Responsibility**           |
+=====================================+================================+
| Christopher                         | GUI                            |
+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Brian Customer                      | Capabilities                   |
+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Kimberly Machine                    | Maintenance                    |
+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Chelsea                             | Data Structures                |
+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------+

> Based on what these individuals are working on during any given day,
> they have a logical partner in the team member who has the expertise
> and/or owns the functionality most closely related to the task at
> hand. For example, consider the following pairings:

+----------------------------------+-----------------+----------------+
| > **Task**                       | > **Task        | > **Partner**  |
|                                  | > Owner**       |                |
+==================================+=================+================+
| GUI for \"Buy Drink\"            | Christopher     | Brian          |
+----------------------------------+-----------------+----------------+
| GUI for \"Add Inventory\"        | Christopher     | Kimberly       |
+----------------------------------+-----------------+----------------+
| GUI for \"Add Recipe\"           | Christopher     | Kimberly       |
+----------------------------------+-----------------+----------------+
| Input Coins/Return Coins         | Brian           | Christopher    |
+----------------------------------+-----------------+----------------+
| Select Drink                     | Brian           | Chelsea        |
+----------------------------------+-----------------+----------------+
| Ingredient Data Structure        | Chelsea         | Kimberly       |
+----------------------------------+-----------------+----------------+
| Recipe Data Structure            | Chelsea         | Kimberly       |
+----------------------------------+-----------------+----------------+
| Add Ingredients                  | Kimberly        | Chelsea        |
+----------------------------------+-----------------+----------------+

+----------------------------------+-----------------+----------------+

> As the GUI expert, Christopher is the owner of every GUI task. His
> partner is the person whose code the GUI is \"touching.\" By pairing,
> Christopher gains the continual reviewer, brainstorming partner.
> However, his partner is also there to share expertise on the inner
> workings of the program logic that his GUI interacts with. His partner
> also gains great insight on the GUI it needs to interact with. In
> turn, Christopher will then partner with Brian and Kimberly when they
> work on their program logic for customer capabilities and machine
> maintenance. Brian and Kimberly will then own the task and Christopher
> will be the partner. All gain knowledge on how best to have their
> respective code interact while maintaining their area of specialty.
> All gain by having the expert in the area their code \"touches\"
> sitting right by their sides. All broaden their project knowledge.
>
> You will notice that Christopher (GUI) and Chelsea (data structures)
> never pair and that Kimberly (machine maintenance) and Brian (customer
> capabilities) never pair. This is because their code does not interact
> directly with each other, so they are not \"logical\" partners. If

### Partner Assigning Logistics

> So how do these dynamic pairings get assigned? We will describe two
> very different ways; many variations occur. There is one common
> denominator, though. In order for pair rotation to occur, project
> responsibilities need to be broken into a manageable task of less than
> a week. Especially in large projects, team members could be assigned
> functionality that might take three to six months to develop. With
> pair rotation, this three to six months\' worth of functionality would
> need to be broken into smaller half-day to one-week chunks. Then the
> owner can recruit partners for these smaller chunks.
>
> Before describing some ways to assign partners, we address a common
> area of resistance to dynamic pairing. Christopher says, \"When I said
> it would take me three months to develop the GUI, I didn\'t know I was
> going to have to spend some of my time helping Kimberly and Brian do
> their code. I don\'t have enough time to help them and still get my
> own work done!\" The only way to get over this resistance is to give
> it a try.
>
> Others might also wish to develop strong bonds with just one or a few
> members of the team and not to rotate around the whole team. As long
> as the \"rotating team\" is not larger than ten, trust and strong
> bonds can develop because you will be pairing with each other quite
> often.
>
> Following are the two ways that we\'ve observed successful pair
> assignments:
>
> - **Short, daily meetings.** Short,
> daily meetings are a practice of XP and SCRUM, where the entire team
> stands up for a short, 10--15-minute meeting (this keeps the meeting
> short, because no one can sit down until the meeting is over). The
> focus of attention goes around the room as everyone on the team
> briefly describes what was accomplished the previous day, what
> problems were encountered, and what needs to be worked on this
> particular day. Depending on what problems the person is facing or
> what the person hopes to accomplish that day, the appropriate team
> member in the room might say, \"I\'ll pair with you on that today,\"
> or \"I had that problem once too. This morning, I can show you what I
> did to solve it.\" After everyone in the room has spoken, hopefully
> everyone knows what he or she is doing that day and with whom he or
> she will partner. If not, the manager or team leader can assign the
> most appropriate pairings from those who are left. (If you recall, our
> initial scenario in [Chapter 1](#chapter-1.-introduction) was
> an example of one of these meetings.)
>
> Pair programming aside, these short, daily meetings are very
> beneficial for team communication. Within this short, 15-minute
> period, the team is synchronized and ready to go. These daily meetings
> are a published organizational pattern. This pattern states \"A short,
> daily meeting is an efficient way of transmitting information to the
> entire team with the minimum communication overhead. This helps
> overcome some of the tunnel vision problems\" (Coplien 2002).
>
> - **Just say yes.** Another method of
> assigning pairs is that a task owner asks the appropriate team member
> to pair with him or her for a task. The team member is not allowed to
> say no. The only question, then, is when they will pair, a scheduling
> issue. Whoever asks first, goes first. However, if you give help, it
> is fair to expect help in return (Newkirk and Martin 2002).

> Good knowledge management techniques are important for employers and
> employees alike. Truly, it is not advantageous to have all knowledge
> in any area of a system known to only one person. For the employer,
> this is very risky because the loss of one or a few individuals can be

> Much of the recent investment in knowledge management has focused on

> share documents or compare data. Invaluable knowledge can also be
> distributed throughout an organization simply by humans sharing
> insights and ideas with other humans. Pair programming is a mechanism
> for encouraging this valuable exchange. Through the use of pair
> programming, organizations can create Communities of Practice (CoP), a
> group of professionals that develop bonds between each other because
> they have jointly solved problems together (McDermott 2000). Members
> of a CoP develop a common sense of purpose and a desire to share
> work-related knowledge and experience. CoP members gain from each
> other knowledge that extends far beyond \"book learning.\"
>
> As programmers rotate among the group, they get the chance to get to
> know many on their team more personally. This familiarity serves to
> break down many communication barriers. Team members find each other
> much more approachable. They will struggle with questions or lack of
> information for less time before getting themselves out of their
> chairs and going to ask the right person a question because they know
> that person quite well. CoP enables person-to-person sharing of tacit
> knowledge, ideas, and insights that are not documented and are hard to
> articulate; sharing of tacit knowledge takes place daily in the normal
> course of the programmers\' day.
>
> James Euchner, vice president of Nynex\'s research and development
> department, reports that CoPs allowed them to reduce the number of
> days from 17 to 3 days to set up data services for customers (Stewart
> 1996). This type of efficiency gain explains why a pair of programmers
> can complete a programming task in approximately half the time as one
> solo programmer.

Alistair Cockburn shares the following story from his interview files
(Cockburn and Williams 2001):

> When I arrived, I saw a disheartening sight: Bill didn\'t have a team;
> he had a random collection of six, bright, talented individuals who
> didn\'t work together. They didn\'t sit near each other; they didn\'t
> even like each other. Here is a scene from a weekly staff meeting:

\'Let\'s talk about pair programming. (Benefits of pair programming
enumerated.) \<pause>

> Therefore pair programming is mandatory. All production code must be
> written with a partner present.\'
>
> \<An awkward silence descends. Furtive eye glances are exchanged.\>
>
> ...
>
> Some of the first paired sessions went smoothly. Other sessions were
> awkward. Communication was serial and parsimonious. I handheld these
> guys by becoming a third wheel. I encouraged the developers to think
> out loud (what Ward Cunningham calls *reflective articulation*). This
> did the trick. They actually began to work together, not just take
> turns coding.
>
> After about a week, I noticed a remarkable phenomenon. The developers
> were talking to each other---as people. You really would have to have
> been there at the beginning to appreciate this. Anyway, I noticed them
> having real conversations and laughing. They actually began to enjoy
> and trust each other.
>
> Within several weeks, they became a real team.
>
> It is through \"becoming a real team\" that pair programming
> encourages the creation of CoP.
>
> The knowledge management capabilities of pair programming can be
> summarized by the reflection of Kurt, a manager at a large corporation
> in North Carolina, via personal communication with Laurie. Kurt hired
> RoleModel Software to develop software for a strategic business
> application. RoleModel assigned Duff and Michael to be the primary
> developers. These programmers followed all the XP practices, including
> pair programming. After observing them and seeing their remarkable
> results, Kurt likened pair pro-gramming and pair rotation to bees
> pollinating an orchard. \"The pollination of flowers is a \'lucky
> accident\' that happens when bees and other animals accidentally brush
> against the stomas leaving pollen grains
> behind.\"[\[2\]](#bookmark87) With pair programming, the
> nuggets of knowledge left behind with pairing partners are indeed
> \"lucky accidents\" of the technique. In addition, both partners can
> then propagate the nugget throughout the team.

> deliver the most critical business value. Kurt also reports that from
> time to time either Duff or Michael was not available. RoleModel

> Adding staff to a project consumes valuable resources of existing team

> Traditionally programmers have been measured based on output: \"You
> completed the keyboard, mouse, and video drivers for Window XP on
> schedule. You had a below average number of defects reported during
> system test.\" For obvious reasons, probably because people help each
> other and it can be hard to isolate who is responsible for which
> success (or failure), pairing destroys this method of evaluation.
> Positively, pairing motivates team success over individual success.
>
> But ultimately, almost all organizations rate each individual on his
> or her performance. We suggest that peer evaluation be factored into
> individual appraisals. IBM and other companies have been using peer
> evaluation for years, even without pair programming. So it appears
> that peer evaluation is useful in its own right. After all, who knows
> better what employees are really doing than that person\'s peers? A
> short form is developed to collect information on the contributions
> and abilities of a developer. At appraisal time, a specified number of
> peers are asked to complete the form for the person under review. The
> manager factors this peer input into the performance appraisal.
>
> Quite possibly, personality conflicts may be present within a team.
> This can be handled in one of three ways. First, the employee under
> review could be asked to provide the names of a certain number of
> peers to evaluate him or her. The manager should know if these are
> names of work collaborators and not just friends. These people are
> then contacted for peer evaluations. Second, the manager should use
> his or her judgment if one peer evaluation provides input that varies
> widely from the others\', input---either positively or negatively. The
> manager should have the authority to discount a peer evaluation from
> the final appraisal. A third possibility is to ask the employee under
> review for a list of names of peers who should *not* be asked for an
> evaluation. The manager is then free to ask anyone else. Assuming that
> this list is short, it can be an effective way of making sure that
> those with personality conflicts do not unfairly slant the evaluation.
> If the list is long, then something else may be wrong.
>
> An astute manager won\'t have to wait until peer evaluation time to
> discover a teammate with a problem. For example, at the end of the
> daily stand-up meeting, that person might not have been recruited to
> be anyone\'s partner; no one ever asks to pair with this person. This
> can be a signal of any number of problems: personality, hygiene,
> communication, and so on. Whatever the issue is, it should be pursued
> to resolution by the manager. This is a good thing, considering the
> alternative of this lone programmer working (or not) in his or her own
> cube for days, weeks, or months at a time with some lingering problem.
>

### Group Size

> We\'ve been asked many times about the size of a pair programming
> group. How does pairing scale? How small can your team be? How large
> can your team be?
>
> To begin, let\'s consider that with solo programming, the \"atomic\"
> unit of a team is one person. How does programming scale with solo
> programmers? Small, colocated groups need less formal communication.
> At the other end of the spectrum, large, distributed teams probably
> need more formal communication. We believe that with pair programming
> the \"atomic\" unit of a team becomes two. Other than that, the same
> scaling rules apply: Small colocated teams of pairs need less formal
> communication (much of which is done side by side), and large,
> distributed teams of pairs require more formal communication. Pair
> programming scales in a way similar to the way solo programming
> scales.
>
> However, pair rotation puts some constraints on the size of the
> \"rotation group.\" It\'s meaningless to pair with a different person
> daily in your 200-per-son development team. You never really get to
> know anyone or anything about the person\'s code. An ideal rotation
> group appears be about 10--12 people. With this size group, people can
> develop personal relationships with their teammates and can get to
> know all of the code within the group. Often large development teams
> are broken into group\'s of this size anyway.
>
> What about small groups? What about groups with odd numbers of
> programmers? Obviously, the smallest group\'s size is two. One day,
> Laurie was at a company that had three programmers on a team doing
> pair programming. Only two paired at a time, which inevitably left one
> person working alone. Luckily, the programmers worked in a wonderfully
> open area. As Laurie talked to the manager, she observed the behavior
> of the three working in the background. Probably once every ten
> minutes, the \"third wheel\" rolled his chair closer to consult with
> the working pair. The working pair never acted like his interruptions
> bothered them in the least. They brokered into triplet brainstorming
> for a short period of time, he rolled away back to his own computer,
> and they went back to work. It was a beautiful display of teamwork. If
> you have an odd number of programmers, we\'d encourage you to make
> sure the person who works alone changes daily or sooner.
>
> Hopefully, your team will welcome spontaneous collaboration by the
> person left out, as this team did.
>

### Quality Assurance

> Watts Humphrey (1995), describes quality assurance activities, such as
> code review, design review, compile, and test as filters for defect
> removal. Depending on the effectiveness of the activity, each filter
> can remove a percentage of the defects that have been injected, but no
> filter is perfectly effective (and can remove all defects). For
> example, if there are 100 defects in some production code, a 50
> percent effective code review will find 50 of the defects. Now the
> code might go on to test with 50 defects remaining. Often testing is
> not as effective a filter, so perhaps 30 percent of the defects might
> be found in test, allowing 35 defects to ship to the customer.
>
> Pair programming provides another filter. The more filters the better,
> if we want high-quality code. It goes a bit beyond that, however.
> Through brainstorming, pairing can prevent defects in the first place,
> and, generally, defect prevention is more efficient than the most
> efficient defect removal filter. Also, pairing can be a very effective
> defect removal process (filter) as the navigator actively works to
> identify defects that are injected.
>
> But what about organizations that have formal QA activities and
> checkpoints? Where does pair programming fit into these checkpoints?
> First, we\'ve heard of several organizations that do not produce
> life/safety critical systems that have substituted pair reviews for
> code reviews; pair programming is a continual code review itself.
> However, as we discuss in [Chapter
> 26](#chapter-26.-moving-ahead-going-beyond), a piece of research
> that still must be done is a formal experiment to assess the
> effectiveness of code reviewing pair programmed code. It is likely
> that pair programmed code does not need to be reviewed. However, we
> are not qualified to declare that just yet.
>
> Many organizations have external testing groups (that is, people
> within the organization, but not the original code developers) that
> perform test cases based on the original customer requirements and/or
> the specification. Obviously, when test cases run smoothly, testing
> goes faster. When testers run into problems each time they turn a
> corner, testing goes much slower because of the need to document and
> recreate problems and to discuss them with code developers. We would
> fully expect that a testing organization that got pair programmed code
> for the first time would be pleasantly surprised at how smoothly
> testing proceeded because of the higher quality.
>
> At the start of the project, these external testing groups give an
> estimate of how much time they will spend executing their test cases.
> Should these organizations take a leap of faith and decrease their
> \"normal\" estimates considering the code will likely be of higher
> quality? Chapters
> [4](#chapter-4.-overcoming-management-resistance-to-pair-programming),
> [5](#chapter-5.-gaining-support-and-acceptance-from-your-peers),
> and[6](#chapter-6.-transitioning-to-pair-programming-by-choice)
> talk about the resistance of many people to pair programming; testers
> will also be skeptical. Seeing is believing. It is likely that the
> testing groups will want to see the higher-quality code before
> believing they will actually get it. After all, if they drastically
> reduce their test estimates assuming higher quality and they don\'t
> get it, they\'ll be working nights and weekends to get their job done.
>
> We would, however, encourage testing groups to estimate a conservative
> reduction. Remember Parkinson\'s Law: \"Work expands to fill all
> available time.\" The testing effort might take the normal amount of
> time even with higher quality. We\'d also encourage you to measure the
> testing results (something like defects/thousand lines of code) and to
> compare these to past projects. Over time, you need to gain confidence
> that testing really will go more smoothly, and numbers will help to
> convince you of this.
>

### Functional and System Testing

> We\'ve also been asked many times whether the testers themselves
> should pair. We would, in fact, encourage testers to pair as they
> create their test cases, especially if it involves writing some test
> code. As we\'ve said before, the more complex a task, the more
> beneficial it is to pair. Writing test cases can be quite complex.
>
> Testers look at the customer requirements and/or specification and
> need to come up with an execution sequence that attempts to
> demonstrate whether the requirement or specification has been properly
> implemented. Then they need to think diabolically about all the
> possible things users can do wrong as they try to use that
> functionality so they can make sure the code handles these situations
> gracefully. Just think how creative a pair of testers can become when
> they put their heads together and think diabolically! We\'ve also seen
> that after testers write the test cases together, they tend to execute
> the test cases separately (although often physically close to each
> other). When they find a problem, they find a partner with whom to
> discuss the symptoms and results. Often they first have to determine
> if the problem is with the test code or with the code under test.
> Working with their testing partner makes good sense, until the defect
> is attributed to the code under test. Then the tester should pair with
> the code developer.
>
> With Extreme Programming, the customers work with the development team
> to create acceptance test cases. Through a pairing of a customer and a
> developer, excellent test cases can be created. However, as important,
> the developer can gain new understanding of what the customer actually
> wants. Customers often know what they want (the success paths through
> the code), but they are not as clear about what they might do to make
> things go wrong (the failure paths through the code). We\'d encourage
> a pair of developers/testers to augment the customer acceptance test
> cases with failure test cases. (It\'s a fact of life that these
> failure test cases ultimately happen in the customer location, so we
> might as well be prepared.) Remember, think diabolically!
>

### Maintaining and Enhancing Code

> We\'ve also been asked about maintaining and enhancing code---does
> pairing work here? We\'ve done extensive surveying on this topic. All
> in all, the feeling is that pairing is often as beneficial for
> maintaining and enhancing code as for writing new code. (Some say that
> maintenance can sometimes be simple, rote work and pairing is not
> justified. In these cases, it is hard to keep the navigator engaged.)
>
> Fixing defects and maintaining code can be quite complex and requires
> detective-like skills. In this case, it is conducive to collaborative
> problem solving. Two can figure out what is going on better than one
> can. When a pair discusses what they see in the code, they gain
> further understanding of what\'s going on. They can validate (or
> invalidate) each other\'s theories about the code. They are also less
> likely to introduce new defects in the course of their work.
>
> A pair is more likely to make more aggressive changes because their
> fear of making a mistake is reduced. You know how it is: \"I\'m not
> going to touch that code, you touch it.\" Having another person with
> you makes you feel more comfortable in making tough decisions.
>
> Many also highly recommended that the pair consist of an original code
> writer whenever possible. In this manner, code can rapidly be
> enhanced. Over time the code maintainer will gain greater insight into
> the entire system from the original coders.
>
> Bob Hartman, vice president of engineering at eSoft explains the
> results his company has seen from transitioning his maintenance team
> to pair programming.
>
> After starting to use Pair Programming, eSoft has an almost-perfect
> success rate at fixing defects correctly (that is, problem resolved,
> no other problems created). In our product, QA time is significant, so
> decreasing it means not only is the product better, but we have also
> saved money, and in the end the start to finish time on projects is
> often approximately the same as it was when we did single person
> programming. Said another way, the gain in QA made up for the loss in
> time programming with two people.

### Chapter 11. Tips \'n Tricks

> Pairing isn\'t always easy. We\'ve compiled a list of suggestions for
> making your pair programming experiences as fruitful as possible.

1.  Give the driver at least a few nanoseconds to find and correct his
    > or her own mistakes. In addition, give the driver time to find
    > menu choices before giving suggestions or correcting him or her.
    > It gets annoying when someone continually corrects your mistakes,
    > especially typos, when you are about to hit the backspace button
    > yourself. Don\'t second-guess every keystroke. Some people seem to
    > be able to examine several lines visually as they are typing and
    > are constantly moving back and fixing things while they are
    > pushing forward. Others miss the mistakes as soon as the cursor
    > leaves the area. Be observant and adapt to your partner.

2.  If your partner is getting bored or falling asleep, pass him or her
    > the keyboard. If you\'re getting tired, pass your partner the
    > keyboard. If both of you are tired, try getting up, walking
    > around, or taking a break to stop the infinite loop.

3.  If your partner is getting tired or frustrated, grab the keyboard.
    > That\'s one of the beauties of pairing. When you\'re tired, you
    > can be the navigator and be freed of the need to type. But, as a
    > pair, you\'re still moving full steam ahead.

4.  In an aim for peace and harmony, it\'s good to come to an
    > understanding of how pairing will work before getting started with
    > a new partner. Roy Miller of RoleModel Software offers a
    > suggestion: \"One of the best tricks I\'ve ever used when pairing
    > is to start each pairing session with some \'negotiation.\' I lay
    > out what I like and don\'t like when I pair with someone, things I
    > do well and things I don\'t do well, things I need help on, things
    > that bug me to death. Then I listen while the other person does
    > the same. This takes less than five minutes, usually, but the
    > results are staggering. Both members of the pair then can use the
    > pairing session as a time to get work done and to help the other
    > person. I think \'pairing as negotiation\' is a key concept.\"

5. Ultimately, there will be conflict---on design, direction, and
> technique--- between the partners. (If there\'s not conflict, then the
> pairing is experiencing some other form of dysfunction.) There are
> several ways to handle this disagreement.
>
> One way is for the navigator to record (on cards) contentious issues
> that are bothering the driver. Periodically, say every half hour, the
> pair should review the issues. Some of the issues may have disappeared
> as time passes, others may still need to be dealt with. Recording the
> issues on cards allows progress to be made and ensures that concerns
> will be addressed in a focused debate/negotiation.
>
> Another way of handing disagreement is for the pair to separate for a
> specified period of time, say ten minutes or so. During this time,
> each of the pair independently investigates his or her desired
> solution through solo programming, prototyping, or some dedicated
> pencil-and-paper design time. At the end of the time, the pair gets
> back together to discuss their investigation. With more information on
> each solution, hopefully the pair will be able to agree on an approach.
>
> Wayne Conrad offers a variation of this approach. When he\'s in a
> conflict, he says, \"Just let me drive for five minutes. If you like
> what you\'ve seen, you can drive it to completion. If you don\'t like
> what you\'ve seen, we\'ll roll back and go in some other direction.\"
> This has worked well in practice. Handing a timer to the partner is an
> important token. It\'s saying, \"I\'m not tricking you into letting me
> drive my idea to completion; I just want to show it to you. By giving
> you this timer, I\'m promising to quit when it goes \'beep, beep,
> beep\' and then let you decide where to go next.\" It\'s telling your
> partner you are not stealing decision-making power.
>
> Ultimately, there should be a team leader/coach/manager who resolves
> between partners issues that just cannot be resolved on their own.
>
> There needs to be a balance between holding one\'s ground and
> compromise. Be assertive without being aggressive. A partner who
> always gives in to his or her partner\'s (perhaps adamant) suggestion,
> is doing a great disservice to the team. Similarly, a programmer who
> never gives in or never gives his or her partner\'s ideas a fair
> chance may as well not be pairing. Pairs that insist on debating every
> single issue are impeding progress. Choose your battles wisely; save
> them for issues that really matter.

6.  Use a coding standard. This eliminates partner disagreement due to style.
    
7.  Use test-driven development. Test-driven development is an Extreme
    > Programming practice in which programmers write automated test
    > cases (using a test suite like Junit [\[1\]](#bookmark102))
    > before writing code. The idea is to write incrementally and
    > iteratively a few test cases, then write a few lines of code to
    > make the test cases pass. Write a few test cases; write some code.
    > You know the drill: Lather, rinse, repeat.

        > [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestingFramework](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki%40TestingFramework).

> Several people have said that they really started to realize the value
> of pair programming once they coupled it with test-first programming.
> They cite that by writing the test first, both partners in the pair
> have a more firm grasp on the problem they are solving. In [Chapter 8](#chapter-8.-workplace-layout), we talked about Bill Wood and
> Bil Kleb at NASA Langley who have two displays---one with the test
> cases and the other with production code. In this way, one of the
> partners writies the test code, and the other writes production code.
> They rotate the roles of driver and navigator very quickly as each of
> them writes test and production code.
>
> Because so many people profess the coupling of pair programming and
> test-driven development, we have an introduction to the technique and
> an outline of its professed benefits in [Appendix D](#appendix-d.-an-introduction-to-test-driven-development).

8.  Practice active listening (Helgesen and Brown 1994) by
acknowledging, restating, and summarizing ideas and discussion
points. Be empathetic toward your partner.

9.  Talk a lot. Talk about what you\'re doing. It helps your partner
understand what you\'re doing, and you might realize a flaw in
your logic as you talk. Explain techniques for using the
development environment.

10. If your partner is just not listening to you at all, get up and walk
away. This is a strong sign of your displeasure that hopefully
will help your partner to see the error of his or her ways.

11. Just ask! If you don\'t understand what your partner is doing, then
stop and ask. If you still don\'t understand, ask again. Ask
yourself, \"When I get handed the keyboard am I going to be able
to carry on doing this?\" If not, ask again. \"Trust me, it\'ll
work\" is definitely not an acceptable answer from the driver.

In a mentoring situation, the mentor can ensure and enhance the
understanding of the learner by asking him or her lots of questions in
a pseudo-Socratic dialog (Brignac 1997, Cyrs 1994); the mentor can ask
good questions in order to emphasize what is important and relevant.

By asking questions, you help the driver divulge his or her thoughts
at all points. This keeps the pairing more collaborative instead of
one person working and one person watching. As we said earlier, in an
effective pairing relationship no more than a minute should go by
without some form of communication. To accomplish this, there has to
be a lot of talking and a lot of asking---oh, and a lot of listening!

12. Take enough showers; eat lots of breath mints. Enough said.

# Part III: Pair Programming Partner Picking Principles [\[1\]]{.ul}

> Often, we hear questions like, \"It would never be worth it to pair
> two of your best people together, would it?\" \"Is there any kind of
> pairing that just doesn\'t seem to work?\" \"It must be very
> frustrating for the expert who has to spend a lot of time pairing with
> the junior people. Is that what you find?\" \"What\'s the most
> effective kind of partner to have, someone of equal skill to
> yourself?\" Our response is basically that there are lots of different
> kinds of pairs---each has benefits and drawbacks in particular
> situations. So, it\'s very good to match the makeup of your pair to
> the task at hand. Need a seemingly impossible algorithm? Put two
> experts on it. After their morning session together, they\'ll spend
> the afternoon completing the patent application. A relatively routine
> task? Put two novices on it and they\'ll \'high five\' each other as
> they leave for lunch. Again, a relatively routine task? Put two
> experts on it and see their blood pressure rise...or one of them fall
> asleep. You get the picture.
>
> There are also pair programming pairs that flat out won\'t work. If
> you recognize these situations, make a decision to move toward one of
> the ones that do work, or maybe to be a maverick (a term Ken Auer of
> RoleModel Software uses for a solo programmer). Like we said,
> pairing\'s not for everyone.
>
> We\'ve also been questioned over and over again about issues such as
> gender and cultural differences between the pairs. Our experience has
> shown that these are non-issues. We do recognize that they could
> become \"issues.\" But if they do, they tend to be very deep-seated
> problems that go beyond pairing.
>
> In [Part Three](#part-iii-pair-programming-partner-picking-principles-1),
> we will guide you through seeing the benefits and drawbacks of various
> pairings so that you can apply these to your own particular context.
> We show you when they work and, if there are problems, offer some
> suggestions on resolving them. Using this information, you can best
> match your pair to your task to maximize the efficiency of the pair.
> Or, to know when to disband a pair.
>
> In each chapter, we complete a template for each of these different
> kinds of pairings. The meta-level template for each chapter in this
> section is as follows: title, illustration, scenario, descriptive
> sections, and lastly personal scenarios.
>
> - The title describes the topic area and
> also indicates if this is a non-issue or a problem area.
> - The illustration attempts to give some
> context for the scenario. These pictures were drawn by a very talented
> artist, Jennifer Kohnke.
>
> - The scenario provides a sometimes

> given the particular situation. Let us say it again; these are
> *usually* how *not* to handle the pairing---they are a (hopefully
> humorous) look at an exaggerated pair of this type.
> For the beneficial pairs, the descriptive section includes the
> following topics:
>
> - intent---when you should use this kind
> of pair and what you should hope to see in this type of pairing;
>
> - characteristics of success---how a successful pairing works; and
>
> - challenges---areas that you should watch out for.
>
> The problem pairings includes topics on:
>
> - root causes---what the problem really is;
> - general form---how you recognize the problem; and
> - refactored solution---what you should do to solve the problem if you happen to have it.
>
> The nonissue section includes these topics:
> 
> - issue---a statement about what is the concern
> - what this is about; and---more details about the issue; and
> - if there are problems---we offer some possible solutions.
>
> Finally, the Personal Scenarios section includes quotes that we
> received from many practicing pair programmers, including things to do
> and things to look out for. Many of the quotes in this section of the
> book came from an extensive Web-based survey of these professional
> pair programmers. Many thanks to all of you who participated!
>
> Much of this section involves characteristics of people. You should
> not think of these characteristics as individual people, but roles

### Intent

> To get even the most complex job done well.
>
> As Ron Jeffries of Object Mentor says, \"When the two experts get in
> sync, you can hear the lightning crackling. Working with a good expert
> partner is like gaining 40 or more IQ points.\"
>

### Characteristics of Success

> As Aretha Franklin sings in the song \"Respect,\" \"R-E-S-P-E-C-T.
> Find out what it means to me.\" The bottom line to successful
> expert-expert pairing is respect. When there is mutual respect between
> the experts, then the sky is the limit for what can be accomplished.
> The experts can push each other to exceed their limits far better than
> either one can do alone. Experts don\'t have to spend much time
> explaining things to one another. It is almost as if they are on a
> different plane of existence; they can often communicate using few
> words. They can be seen examining the situation, rejecting several
> competing ideas, and quickly zooming in on the best solution. The
> expert-expert pair can be running with their speedometer pegged at the
> maximum speed.
>
> As you might guess, running at this top speed can be exhilarating yet,
> at the same time, quite intense and exhausting. We have observed in
> expert-expert pairing is a fair amount of joking around and kidding
> with each other (again, that old \"respect\" surfaces here, as experts
> who are kidding around with each other, clearly respect and feel very
> comfortable with their partners). Certainly, they are having fun, but
> we feel that it may also be something deeper. The levity is a means of
> slowing down, reducing the tension, and making the exhausting parts
> easier to handle. The levity gives the experts time to breathe before
> taking the plunge into another intense session.
>
> Another successful expert-expert pairing is when the two experts bring
> very different skills to the problem. For example, when one expert is
> working on integrating his or her part of the system with a module
> that is \"owned\" by another expert, the benefits can be enormous.
> Having the two experts work together will ultimately lead to a
> well-functioning integration, often improving the two modules in the
> process.
>
> Finally, one of the most important benefits of the expert-expert pairs
> is that the knowledge and learning gained by each of the experts
> enhance their expertise. It has been our experience that when
> interacting with your partner you inevitably learn new things.
> Sometimes you learn about your partner\'s area; however, more often
> than not, the experience teaches you something new about your own area
> of expertise.
>

### Challenges

### Personal Scenarios

> Bob recalls his first experience at pair programming back in the early
> \'90s while on sabbatical at
>
> Hewlett-Packard Research Labs working with Martin Griss, the renowned
> \"Reuse Rabbi\" (Jacobson et al. 1997). This was long before they even
> knew of XP or pair programming. Their setup was not ideal in terms of
> how the computer and chairs were laid out. (Martin\'s office has the
> computer on an inside corner, so whoever played the role of navigator
> had to sit slightly behind and look over the driver\'s shoulder.)
> Because Martin never learned to touch type, Bob was constantly razzing
> him about his poor typing. Bob and Martin continue to pair program
> today. It has become even more difficult recently because Martin has a
> bad case of RSI and has rigged his work environment with large buttons
> he can press with his palms, and he can use a huge trackball instead
> of a mouse. However, even with all these challenges, pair programming
> is truly an amazing experience. There is total and complete respect
> between Martin and Bob, there are no egos, and they both know and
> understand each other so well that it truly is two minds thinking as
> one. From the early experiences with Visual Basic and building a
> component-based graphical programming system to measurement systems
> and, more recently, to personal agents, each and every task has
> benefited from pair programming (in the broadest sense of the phrase,
> which includes requirements, design, implementation, and test). Both
> Martin and Bob bring different expertise to the various problems. They
> tend to feed off one another with the result being high-quality,
> functional code that often exceeds their expectations. Having
> experienced it first hand for over a decade, Bob is still amazed at
> how effective and enjoyable pair programming is.
>
> Martin Griss provides his own viewpoint of their expert-expert
> pairing:
>
> Actually, Bob and I go way back. I remember some late evenings in the
> late \'70s at the University of Utah when we were developing a
> microcoded LISP system on a Burroughs B1700. We came very close to
> pair programming. Together we would develop pieces of test code in
> LISP, and one of us would hand compile and assemble a stream of byte
> codes while the other would type them in \"...5 0 foo....\" In those
> days, I could type amazingly fast with two and four fingers, and I
> fancied myself a great programmer. These days, I am not anywhere as
> good a programmer (or typist) as Bob, and so we tend most of the time
> to
>
> have slightly different roles, where Bob is much more effective than I
> at creating complete working systems, quickly. \[*A comment from
> Bob:*Don\'t let him kid you, he was and still is a great programmer!\]
> When we are not at the same console, I might sit to the side. I tend
> to work more on trying alternative mechanisms and fragments, either on
> paper or my machine, and then we work together to integrate the best
> fragment into our evolving code body. I really look forward to the
> times Bob comes out and we work together. Usually I am engaged in lots
> of other managerial or architecture meetings, but when Bob visits, I
> clear my calendar and am able to focus on this task of creating our
> composition and work late into the night. It is exhilarating! The way
> we work feels a lot like playing jazz in a small combo---at times we
> play together; at other times one or the other takes the lead or
> alternates in building on an emerging theme. We have an amazing
> ability to do joint design, complete each other\'s sentences and code,
> and work from a preliminary and incomplete vision. We share a
> philosophy on how systems should evolve and how solutions drive system

### Intent

> To get the average job done well, while raising the skill level of one
> programmer.
>

### Characteristics of Success

> There seem to be two types of average programmers. One type is those
> who have a lot of experience but are, well, just average. The other
> type is those who are on their way to becoming an expert but simply
> lack the experience that is typical of an expert. Our experience tends
> to show that an expert-just average pairing is not very effective.
> We\'ll discuss that pairing more in Challenges later in this chapter.
> However, expert-rising star pairings do work very well and are an
> excellent method for helping that average programmer become a true
> star.
>
> As you will see in the next chapter on expert-novice pairing,
> effective expert-average pairing also requires that the expert do some
> mentoring and \"teaching.\" The average programmer has sufficient
> knowledge about programming that he or she can have a good discourse
> with the expert; it just may require that the expert explain some
> things more than if talking with another expert. Typically the expert
> would not have to explain what a pattern is, but he or she might have
> to explain why a particular pattern is being used in a situation. This
> is not heavy-duty teaching, but it does require that the expert slow
> down during the work and explain more of the reasons \"why.\" It is
> important to realize that there are two kinds of instruction that can
> go on here. The first is teaching programming, tools, the environment,
> and the \"how we do things in this company.\" The second is teaching
> how to pair. It is difficult to teach both of these at the same time.
> The best training is first to learn how to pair and then move into the
> how to program.
>
> Assuming that average programmers know how to pair, they must
> effectively play their role in this relationship. They should not sit
> silently and watch the expert go about business. Average programmers
> must speak up, interact, and ask questions. Naturally, they should not
> become pests and keep asking the same question over and over (this
> will definitely hurt a pairing). It has to become clear to the expert
> that the average programmer is \"getting it,\" otherwise the expert
> will become frustrated.
>
> Another important aspect of this pairing is that the average
> programmer often brings his or her own experiences to the pairing, and
> those fresh ideas often stimulate the expert into new, creative
> solutions to particular problems. Experts are often experts because of
> their experience and their ability to see a situation and draw from
> their vast knowledge base to pull out a trick or technique that will
> solve the problem at hand. The average partner typically has
> sufficient skill to understand what is currently being designed or
> implemented and can often see places where his or her own experience
> might actually lead to a better solution. As long as the experts are
> not so stuck in their own ways and are willing to listen to ideas from
> their partners, this can ultimately lead the pair to producing a
> better asset.
>
> Questions you might be thinking to ask are \"Should the expert become
> a \'professional driver\' and drive all of the time? Or should the
> average programmer drive all of the time?\" We\'ll discuss that in
> Personal Scenarios.
>
> However, we firmly believe that switching driver and navigator is
> always beneficial. The expert can show tricks and tools that can help
> improve the speed of the development process. The average engineer can
> benefit from the expert watching what he or she is doing and providing
> immediate feedback as to the best way to do things. Hands-on
> experience is always beneficial.
>

### Challenges

> As we see it, there are three situations where the expert-average
> pairing is a problem. The first is when the average programmer really
> is average. Quite often programmers like this are good at doing their
> jobs, but they are not open to expanding outside of their area of
> expertise. They take assignments that are similar to what they have
> done in the past, and they tend to work the same way to solve the same
> kinds of problems. These programmers can be so rigid that learning or
> even being exposed to new ideas and concepts is a *bad thing*.
>
> Pairing an expert with these types of programmers should probably be
> avoided. The expert will soon become frustrated and might write off
> the programmer as unwilling to learn.
>
> The second challenge is when average programmers do not interact
> enough with the expert; they do not ask sufficient questions. An
> expert who is driving will often simply keep working and assume that
> his or her partner is following along. Thus opportunities for
> improving the average programmer\'s abilities or for explaining why
> particular decisions are being made will be lost. The average engineer
> must ask questions when he or she doesn\'t understand what is going
> on.
>
> As mentioned earlier, the last significant challenge occurs when the
> average programmer doesn\'t seem to \"get it.\" After having something
> explained once, the average programmer keeps asking the same question
> over and over again. This can leave the expert frustrated and can
> reduce the ability of the pair to complete the task.
>
> Often, this is the fault of the expert who may not be very good at
> explaining things. Or maybe the pair simply does not have enough
> shared background to be able to communicate effectively. In any case,
> good, clear communication between the members of a pairing, where the
> average engineer is able to absorb the information, is imperative to
> making a successful expert-average pairing. We must therefore restate
> this important point: Communication is a key ingredient in all
> successful pairings.
>

### Personal Scenarios

> Wayne Conrad, a consultant, describes the teaching aspects of the
> expert-average pairing:
>
> These can be a lot of fun. There\'s a lot more teaching that takes
> place than in expert-expert pairing, so less code gets produced.
> However, teaching is very rewarding in itself.
>
> Sometimes it\'s hard to have the courage to do this if your boss is
> measuring only the code you deliver.
>
> The ability of the average programmer to pick up new methods and
> techniques is exemplified by Michael Lindner of Sonus Networks:
>
> Without really trying, the \"average\" person picked up a very deep
> understanding of the system being developed, as well as a toolbox full
> of useful tools and techniques.
>
> Greg Houston of Internet Security Systems highlights the idea that the
> average programmer can provide new ideas to the expert:
>
> The average programmer certainly helped a lot. He would call for
> better explanations that forced me to think through solutions better.
> In addition, even working with an average programmer, I find they have
> experience and ideas that add to my own. The \"collective mind\" of
> pairing helps create better code.
>
> Finally, Jim Murphy of Ironring Software discusses the importance of
> the average programmer asking questions:
>
> The average guy could get intimidated easily and not volunteer enough,
> even when he had good input. It can degenerate into an expert-beginner
> \[pairing\] fast if the expert doesn\'t realize that dynamic. Then the
> average guy feels marginalized and doesn\'t have a good experience.

### Intent

> To get the easier job done well, while training a novice programmer.
>

### Characteristics of Success

> You might be thinking: \"Does it ever make sense to pair an expert
> with a novice?\" After all, the expert should be able to solve the
> problem very quickly, and all you would be doing is slowing the expert
> down. Well, it turns out that expert-novice pairs can have several
> advantages. One significant advantage is the training that the novice
> will receive via apprenticeship. The novice will learn by doing and by
> watching what the expert is doing. The novice can see the decisions
> that are being made and ask questions as to why this and that are
> being done.
>
> The novice will gain knowledge about processes used by the team,
> techniques that can be used to solve various problems in different
> situations, and how the team does work. This master/apprentice
> relationship is extremely powerful and one of the best ways for a
> novice to learn to become a valuable member of the team. Interestingly
> enough, we\'ve heard the following comment---almost verbatim---from
> several different development managers: \"We used to consider a new
> person unproductive for their first three months. Now, we find that
> new people can help out almost immediately.\"
>
> The apprenticeship can even be valuable for novices who are novices
> only in the sense that they haven\'t been with their team for very
> long. As they might say on Star Trek: \"It helps them to be
> assimilated into the collective (team).\" Watching and then doing with
> an expert by your side can greatly reduce the time it would require to
> learn \"the right way\" of working with the team. It really helps when
> the newbie works with many of the experts (or with any team member) so
> he or she can learn about many different aspects of the system.
>
> One of the most unexpected aspects of an expert-novice pairing is that
> the novice actually helps the expert to do a better job. We have had
> so many peo-ple tell us this, that it clearly happens and happens
> often. Teachers have a saying, \"You don\'t really know it until you
> have to teach it.\" Experts can come to a far greater understanding of
> a technique by slowly and deliberately explaining it to a novice. It
> usually begins when the expert starts to explain to the novice a
> decision or a design or even how some code is being implemented. The
> novice usually asks several questions and often asks the most
> important question: \"Why?\" When the expert is explaining what is
> going on, sometimes the expert realizes that he or she has made a
> mistake. We believe that this is because the expert slows down and, in
> the process of explaining something, uncovers an invalid assumption.
> When the expert is talking, his or her mind is often reevaluating what
> was done and sometimes a flaw is discovered. We believe that this
> phenomenon is very similar to the \"Tell It To the Furby\" method of
> debugging [\[1\]](#bookmark123) (see pair debugging in[Chapter
> 3](#chapter-3.-the-seven-synergistic-behaviors-of-pair-programming)).
> Sometimes, the listener\'s understanding does not seem to be relevant.
> Both methods involve explaining what you are doing, and by simply
> doing that exercise, better designs or implementations occur and
> problems are often uncovered. In any case, by slowing down at just the
> right places, the novice actually helps the expert to do a better job.

### Challenges

> Clearly, pairing an expert with a novice requires that the expert be
> able to interact with the novice as a teacher would interact with his
> or her students. Some of the characteristics of an effective teacher
> are patience, a willingness to explain, patience, the ability to
> articulate clearly the work that is being done, compassion for the
> student, and, most important, patience. (Yes, we meant to put
> \"patience\" in there three times.) The expert must also create a
> comfortable environment that is nonthreatening. This will be highly
> conducive to making the expert-novice relationship work. So the main
> problem with this pairing is when the expert is unwilling or unable to
> teach or interact in a master/apprentice relationship. In addition, if
> the environment is not comfortable, then the novice will be too
> intimidated to let the pairing succeed or even to learn at all.
>
> Another problem is when the teacher is not open to listening to advice
> from his or her apprentice. Assuming the apprentice has any
> qualifications at all (for example, a college graduate with a degree
> in computer science), the apprentice can pick up on problems and know
> the right questions to ask. The expert has to take off his or her \"I
> am all-knowing\" mask and work in partnership with the novice.
>

### Personal Scenarios

> Our first real-life example comes from Internet Security Systems\'
> Greg Houston. Greg points out that being a novice does not necessarily
> mean a beginner; the person might simply be inexperienced in a
> particular technology:
>
> On my team, this happened mostly where the novice was inexperienced
> with the technology. However, the novice was not a novice programmer.
> So, the novice would pick up the skills in the technology very quickly
> from the expert. Also, the novice would bring in ideas from outside
> the \"box\" which sometimes leads to finding better solutions.
>
> Stu Charlton of Infusion Development brings up the \"p\" word as being
> of high importance (that is, \"patience,\" for those of you who missed
> it earlier):
>
> Lately my job is in mentoring, so I\'ve been doing this a lot. It\'s
> pleasant if you view your job as a mentor or coach. If you\'re trying
> to beat a deadline, you\'re not going to like this arrangement. It
> requires a lot of patience, a great ability to communicate complex
> concepts, and a dose of humility. But, assuming the novice partner
> learned something, the rewards are definitely worth the effort.
>
> Consultant Wayne Conrad echoes the importance of the \"p\" word but
> cautions that it can sometimes be very difficult to make progress.
> This is especially difficult when up against the pressure of some
> deadline.
>
> These drive me crazy. I have problems becoming impatient with students
> who don\'t know enough for me even to communicate with them. With an
> expert, I can say \"Observer?\" and get an answer. With an average
> partner, I can draw some UML and in a few minutes get an answer. With
> a novice, I first have to explain UML, then explain Observer, and then
> explain why decoupling the sender from the receiver is good. Only a
> few times have I been that patient.
>
> The comments by Ironring Software\'s Jim Murphy are about the
> importance of the novice learning the subtleties of a particular task;
> they also mention a psychological trick that sometimes can help the
> situation:
>
> This is the best way to get someone into the game. Oftentimes it\'s
> the subtle things that experts do that are never discussed. To get
> things done well and fast, we invoke some features or Web sites or
> \"process patterns\" without thinking about them. I have had good luck
> with excessive positive reinforcment of a novice\'s work. The
> reciprocal gains produced by the novice feeling as if he or she is no
> longer a novice but a real contributor to the team is a good first
> step in that actually happening.
>
> Ron Jeffries of ObjectMentor mentions that the expert has to involve
> the novice actively:
>
> Novices are often afraid to get involved. You need to let them drive
> or ask them questions that will draw them out. \"Do you understand\"
> doesn\'t work; they\'ll just say yes. There can be a feeling of
> slowness when pairing with a novice, but I believe that even the
> newest novice, in fact, helps me when I pair with him or her. I\'d not
> hesitate to do it.
>
> We conclude with some remarks from Erik Bennerhult of the development
> firm Lejbrink Bennerhult who describes how both the novice and the
> expert benefit from the expert-novice pairing. We feel that the
> following quote really hits home the point that the involvement of the
> novice actually helps the expert in immeasurable ways:
>
> Of particular interest here is that not only the novice programmer
> benefits from this experience, but that the expert often learns just
> as much from having to explain underlying concepts. This generally

### Intent

> To produce production code in a relatively noncomplex area of the
> project, giving valuable experience to both programmers in the
> process.
>

### Characteristics of Success

> The novice-novice pairing can be effective for helping the programmers
> learn. Laurie taught a class where the students were learning about
> several different topics relating to Web-based programming. The class
> was completely paired. She observed that the students learned the
> material better and more quickly than she anticipated. In the computer
> lab, if one partner didn\'t know something, then most of the time the
> other partner had the answer. Alternatively, the navigator would be
> working in parallel, flipping through resource books or class notes to
> fill in areas they both did not know. Generally, students learning
> programming languages are very dependent on their professor for
> technical questions, advice, and debugging. On one hand, answering
> student questions is a big ego boost as you walk around the room and
> play hero. However, it can be quite exhausting. With the pairs,
> though, they were able to teach each other almost everything, and they
> hardly ever asked for help. Aside from experiencing some \"empty nest
> syndrome,\" this change was a big relief to Laurie.
>
> How do these observations relate to a business environment? Assuming
> that the novices have some qualifications---like a degree or
> experience in programming---they can help each other out. If they have
> each previously paired with other team members and have knowledge of
> some areas of the project, they can educate each other. Often, solo
> newbies work too long struggling to understand some aspect of the
> project. Often after working too long (because they don\'t want to
> bother anyone with a question), they will ask a more experienced team
> member for help. This struggling time is unproductive time. (During
> this time, there\'s also generally a lot of negative self-talk, such
> as \"If I weren\'t so stupid, I would know this already.\") With a
> novice pair, if they both don\'t know something, they have the
> conviction to ask for help much more quickly, get the answer, and move
> forward.
>
> We must say that there is a strong caveat to this pair learning. There
> must be a coach, instructor, or mentor available to answer questions
> and also to help guide the pair. This is described in more detail in
> the next sections. We feel very strongly about the need for a coach.
> If you are unwilling to assign the mentoring task to some expert, then
> you need to understand the limitations of the asset being produced by
> the pair. Without this, you can\'t count on the quality of the work
> that the pair produces, although it will certainly be higher than that
> of either of the novices working alone. The novice pair will certainly
> gain valuable experience and will learn a ton!
>

### Challenges

> Since novice programmers by definition lack experience, it is quite
> easy for them to go down a wrong path, focus on something that is not
> important, or spend time spinning their wheels on trivialities. Sure,
> they will still experience pair pressure and not spend time surfing
> the Web, answering e-mail, and so on; but their progress on the task
> at hand can be limited simply because neither of the pair has the
> experience necessary to do an effective job. This challenge can be so

### Personal Scenarios

> Our first example shows that pairing novices can be effective and
> particularly rewarding. Dr. Mike Lance of Christchurch Polytechnic
> Institute of Technology describes how novice pairs know when to ask
> for help instead of wallowing around trying to find a solution:
>
> Students work very happily when they are at the same level. They both
> make the same mistakes and learn to pick them up together. A joint
> decision to ask for help is often made quickly and decisively. \"We
> don\'t know what we are doing, do we? Let\'s get help.\" Students
> working by themselves take longer to figure out that they are doing
> something nonproductive.
>
> Professional programmer Norman Rekitt supports the idea of a good
> coach available for questions:
>
> This is probably the biggest challenge. But with the right attitude it
> works great. You both become experts quickly if you have a good coach.
>
> Many of the survey participants said that pairing novices was a really
> bad idea and they didn\'t do it. The first opinion comes from Ron
> Jeffries of ObjectMentor who says it just doesn\'t work:
>
> I think novice-novice is the most problematical. Blind leading the
> blind. 10 times 10 is 100. 1 times 1 is just...1. I generally advise
> teams to avoid the novice-novice combination as much as possible.
>
> Stephanie Ward of Interliant points out that there is some good via
> pair-learning, but the assets produced are usually not that great:
>
> I think this was a good experience for the two novices, because they
> were forced to come up with design ideas and figure out how to
> implement them. However, I found that I couldn\'t trust the
> development that came from that pair. It took much longer for them to
> finish a task, and they slowed down other pairs (understandably) by
> asking lots of questions. They also didn\'t seem to have a good grasp
> of what they had actually done, so knowledge transfer to experts was
> difficult.
>
> The last point by Steve Hayes of Khatovar Technology Pty Ltd. is quite

>

### Intent

> After long, thoughtful, constructive discussions, an excellent
> creative solution is created.
>

### Characteristics of Success

> As you might imagine, pairing extroverts can be tremendously
> advantageous. Pairing is all about communication, and extroverts
> typically are among the best communicators. They can discuss the
> issues and banter back and forth about ideas. They will often openly
> question decisions, but ultimately they will jointly arrive at the
> best solution.
>

### Challenges

> Extrovert-extrovert pairing is often loud and full of laughter. This
> should be encouraged, if one is in a large room where the pairing
> development is occurring (as often used in XP). However, extrovert
> pairs might spend too much of their time talking, discussing, and
> arguing. If they are not productive, then the pairing will fail.
> Therefore it is important for the manager to observe these extrovert
> teams and make sure that good, productive work products are being
> produced. Extrovert pairs need to be self-disciplined enough to limit
> each discussion to a specific number of minutes. It is true that some
> people just can\'t seem to stop talking, so pairing in general will
>
> not work for them. (In our experience a lot of these people seem to
> end up being academics.)

> Note: In Laurie\'s University of Utah experiment, she paired two
> extroverts (to no surprise, there were very few of them in the class).
> These two spent considerably more time to complete assignments than
> any other pair; they were outliers in the distribution of time spent.
> As a matter of fact, the 15 percent more time spent by pairs would
> have likely been much smaller if it was not for this one pair. This
> pair freely admitted that they had trouble stopping conversations
> about what went on the night before and how hard their operating
> system exam was, and so on---conversations that were totally
> irrelevant to completing the assignment. It was one long continuous
> coffee klutch. Watch for this, and figure out how to shut them up and
> get them to work.

### Personal Scenarios

> It is often the case that extroverts enjoy being with other
> extroverts, as described by Eric Herman:
>
> This is great. Amazing feedback loops! When you get me together with
> another \"talker,\" we can really make things happen!
>
> Vera Peeters of tryx discusses how much fun extrovert pairs
> have---maybe too much: Lots of laughing. Lots of noise.
>
> Ron Jeffries of Object Mentor agrees:
>
> Love it. It\'s more fun, a barrel of laughs. Confident pairing leads
> to easier exploration and more creative solutions.
>
> This is supported by Matthew Cooke of Connextra. He does caution that
> it is important that management understands what is going on and sees
> what is being produced and does not worry about how it was produced:
>
> Much more enjoyable, therefore, more productive. Can concern
> management as developers are clearly not supposed to be laughing and
> having fun.
>
> Professional programmer Jason Rogers relates a funny story about how
> both extroverts tend to be aggressive and want to take control of the
> project, the overall benefit being that a lot of good work gets done:
>
> Person One: I wanna drive. Person Two: Then get in your car.
>
> Person One: Ha ha. Seriously, I wanna type. Person Two: OK. Let\'s
> see; I\'d say you\'re a type A. BANG!!!
>
> Person One: I.S. Department? Hi, this is Person One. I need a new
> keyboard down here.
>
> Seriously, they both tend to want to drive! So, the keyboard switches
> a lot. That\'s a good thing around here.
>
> Several people mention the problems that can occur when pairing
> extroverts. Jeff Langr of Object Mentor discusses the problem of too
> much arguing and how one should set some kind of time limits:
>
> They get contentious with arguments if they are opposed to a given
> direction. Cut all discussion off at an arbitrary mark, say five
> minutes.
>
> Stephanie Ward of Interliant points out the good and bad of extrovert
> pairs:
>
> This has both good and bad aspects. I\'ve seen this pair have
> thoughtful technical discussions that led to better solutions.
> However, this can lead to long discussions that go nowhere.
>
> Jim Murphy of Ironring Software mentions the psychological aspects of
> having so much fun that sometimes you don\'t want it to end:
>
> Fun. Very comfortable feeling resulting from sharing even silly
> details about how we do work. This is a very rewarding feeling.
> Sometimes a feature can take longer than necessary because I am having
> so much fun working on it that I don\'t want to move on and stop
> working with my extroverted pair!
>
> Dave Chaplin of Byte-Vision Ltd. also describes some of the problems
> of pairing extroverts and also offers some interesting solutions on
> how to solve them:
>
> They can spend a little too much time chatting about what they did
> over the weekend, rather than getting the job done. Getting them to
> buy into the timescales normally does the trick.
>
> They also tend to be more focused on the happy flows of code and
> don\'t like to test as much---being a little too optimistic in the
> solution they produce. Making a set of unit tests part of the
> deliverable and reviewing those tests before they code solves this
> one.

### Intent

> To allow each partner to draw on his or her strengths and to improve
> upon his or her weaknesses.
>

### Characteristics of Success

> Introverts just don\'t interact as \"loudly\" as extroverts. To no
> surprise, a lot of introverts end up being programmers. We suspect
> that there is something comforting about sitting in a darkened cube at
> 3:00 in the morning and beating down the last bug in some product.
>
> Let\'s assume that we have two talented people; they are just
> different in how they \"interact.\" When this happens, then the
> pairing can work. But it takes time for the partners to learn to work
> with each other. Introverts need to learn to speak up when it is
> important; likewise, extroverts need to learn to shut up. When this
> happens, it can be a very good pairing. Each gives up a little of what
> he or she is, but is still able to be what he or she is. The pairing
> works.
>
> The key to making this partnership work is for each partner to
> recognize his or her own personality. Extroverts must consciously work
> not to talk all of the time. They can use their \"extrovertedness\" to
> draw valuable information from their partner; they must ask questions
> of their partner. We have heard of extroverts who are driving to make
> mistakes intentionally just so their partner will catch them and learn
> to \"open up.\" Likewise, introverts must push a little and work to
> interact. When they see a problem, they must speak up. If there are
> issues that they don\'t understand or don\'t agree with, then they
> must speak up. They have to learn to express themselves and to let
> their talents show through.
>

### Challenges

> As described earlier, the major challenge of this pairing is that each
> partner must give up a little to learn to pair. The extrovert must
> back off from talking all of the time and the introvert must learn to
> speak up about whatever issue is at hand. The pairing will not work if
> both do not give a little. Either the extrovert will monopolize
> everything, and there will be no input from the introvert, or the
> introvert will be silent and will not interact, thus losing all
> benefits from pairing.
>
> The other challenge is if either partner uses his or her tendencies to
> cover up deficiencies. If this is happening, then it is very difficult
> to make the pairing work. The partner must treat it like an
> expert-novice pairing and will have to take a much more mentoring role
> in the relationship. Again, if this is not recognized, then the
> pairing will not succeed.

### Intent

> A silent intensity leads to rock-solid solutions.
>

### Characteristics of Success

> Many programmers are introverted to some degree. We don\'t have hard
> statistics on it, but the majority of programmers are of Meyers-Briggs
> personality type INTJ (Keirsey 1998, Keirsey 2002)---where the \"I\"
> indicates \"Introverted.\" (In Laurie\'s classes, she\'s noticed that
> between 50 and 75 percent of her students have an \"Introvert\"
> Meyers-Briggs personality type.) Since many programmers are
> introverted to some degree, the introvert-introvert pair will be quite
> common.
>
> Introverts can be fairly quiet and private. They tend to keep to
> themselves and enjoy isolation. Keirsey calls introverts
> \"reserved\"---quick to listen and slow to speak (extroverts, on the
> other hand, are characterized as \"expressive\"---quick to speak and
> slow to listen). Introverts often have a quiet intensity and excel at
> the demanding task of programming. The intensity allows them to focus
> on the task at hand and to work diligently to solve whatever problems
> they are given. Having two introverts tackling a problem can really be
> successful if you can overcome their natural tendency not to
> communicate with their partner. Pair programming works when the pairs
> are tightly integrated, interacting, and working closely. The natural
> intensity of introverts makes interaction a low priority. Thus the
> pair has to work to maintain a decent level of interaction. Having a
> pair of introverts who know each other well can be a real thing of
> beauty. Often there is not a lot of verbal communication, but the pair
> learns how to communicate via other means.
>
> We have found that pairing an introvert with another introvert is an
> effective means of introducing someone to pair programming. If an
> introvert\'s first pairing experiences are with a very extroverted
> person, he or she might find the situation overwhelming or find it
> hard to get a word in and decide to give up trying. However, they
> won\'t have this \"competition\" to talk with another introverted
> person. Instead, intorverts might have a competition on who will be
> the *first* to talk. Through pairing in this nonthreatening way, the
> introverted person can learn to jell constructively with another
> programmer---asserting opinions and questions in a positive way. Once
> they learn how to do this, introverts might be better prepared to be
> assertive with a more extroverted partner.
>

### Challenges

> The difficulty of this pairing is that introverts can be very poor
> communicators. As you have seen in much of the text prior to this
> chapter, pair programming is all about communicating. If there is no
> communication, there is no pair programming. As some of the stories
> related in the personal scenarios section will show, this is a very
> difficult issue to overcome. The best solution seems to be to keep on
> pairing and to let the introverts get to know each other. Once that
> happens they open up and become much more productive.
>
> It is also important that the manager who arranges this kind of pair
> keeps an early eye on the partners. Experience has shown that during
> this \"longer pair-jelling\" period, the pair is sometimes not very
> productive and often ends up going down the wrong paths because they
> are not interacting and questioning each other. A good technique for
> the manager or other technical lead is to interact with the pair
> often, see what they have been doing, and make sure that they are
> progressing.
>
> Finally, a lot of introverts would rather be locked away in an office
> by themselves, working intensely on a project, emerging only when it
> is done. Many times, they will strongly resist pairing. We recommend
> that the manager takes it slowly, pair a little at a time until the
> pair becomes comfortable with the concept. It is certainly the case
> that some introverts will resist so strongly that they will never be
> able to pair.
>

### Personal Scenarios

> As you might guess, we have several stories of successful introvert
> pairs and stories of unsuccessful introvert pairs that did not work
> out as well. However, the first from Dr. Mike Lance of Christchurch
> Polytechnic Institute of Technology makes an excellent point of what
> we mean by the term \"introvert\":
>
> Introverts tend to be intense and have lots going on inside their
> heads. This would be the typical programming student personality
> profile. Introvert is not the same as low in social skills.... Not a
> noisy group, but happy to do something task-focused.
>
> Todd Jonker of Inpath Solutions talks about how the bottom line is
> communication between the pairs:
>
> Gotta open up! This can work if the coders are comfortable with each
> other. Might be hard if they\'re both shy and strangers.
>
> Both Jeff Langr of Object Mentor and Christian Wege of DaimlerChrysler
> AG mention the problems when an introverted pair does not go seeking
> help. As we stated earlier, this implies that the technical lead
> should seek out the pair and make sure that they stay on track:
>
> Tends to be quiet; not as much communication between the two as should
> occur. They are less likely to raise their hand to the other
> developers if they get bogged down. Much like the novice-novice
> pairing, the introvert-introvert pairing should be avoided. *(Jeff)*
>
> In a workshop such a pair was going in the wrong direction for a long
> time. They didn\'t approach the coach early enough and didn\'t
> question the partner\'s work enough. *(Christian)*
>
> Roy W. Miller of RoleModel Software, Inc. provides an excellent
> illustration of our point that if you work at it, you can get an
> introverted pair to work and work well. What is interesting about this
> scenario is that one of the partners (Roy) recognized the difficulty
> of this particular kind of pairing and worked hard to make sure that
> the pair was successful:
>
> One of the guys at my company is usually very quiet, and people give
> him quite a hard time about it. The first time I paired with him, he
> just didn\'t talk. I\'m introverted myself, so I fight it by forcing
> myself to engage people. I asked questions but got no answers. So, I
> increased the frequency of my questions. Still nothing. By the end of
> the session, there was a steady stream of questions pouring from my
> mouth, and my introvertd partner was noticeably frustrated with me.
> Over time, he and I have gotten to know one another outside of work.
> In developing that relationship, we have talked about the good and the
> bad of pairing. We have talked about how we pair. Now, he and I pair
> rather well. It took a longer \"negotiation\" with him to get to the
> point where our pairing could be productive, but it was worth the
> effort.

### Issue

> Gender is not an issue.
>

### What This Is About

> You might wonder why we even bother to have a chapter on gender issues
> (male/male, male/female, or female/female pairs). After all, our
> profession is relatively young, and it would seem highly enlightened.
> The gender of each member of the pair should just not matter! Well, we
> added this chapter because we have been asked about it, and it might
> be a question that you too have. The bottom line is that it really
> does not seem to matter. What really matters are the same issues that
> we have addressed in other chapters in [Part
> Three](#part-iii-pair-programming-partner-picking-principles-1):
> the similarities and differences in partners\' skill levels; how
> outgoing the partners are; and whether there are problems related to
> professional driving (see [Chapter
> 21](#chapter-21.-the-professional-driver-problem)) or egos (see
> Chapters[22](#chapter-22.-my-partner-is-a-total-loser-and-other-excess-ego-problems)
> and
> [23](#chapter-23.-my-partner-is-so-smart-and-other-too-little-ego-problems)).
> So, a successful pairing is based on these characteristics and not on
> gender.
>
> As we have stated many times before, communication is a key ingredient
> to successful pairing. We have observed that men and women communicate
> differently. Generally speaking, men attempt to convey information;
> they speak mostly about things. Women communicate to receive
> information or to improve relationships and speak mostly about people
> (Glass 1993). It is important to realize that there are real
> differences in communication methods, to recognize them, and to handle
> them effectively.
>

### If There Are Problems

> About the only problem that we can envision is one related to gender
> disrespect. Should either gender disrespect the other, problems are
> likely. Because pairs work so closely together, this type of gender
> chauvinism could become more noticeable and become a real problem.
> However, it is likely that gender disrespect issues would surface in
> any team-based situation and thus does not seem to be specific to pair
> programming. Should these issues arise, we see no solution but to
> recommend some type of counseling for those with a chauvinism problem.
> We feel that this kind of bias has no place in the work place in
> particular nor in society in general.
>

### Personal Scenarios

> Our Web survey asked about issues relating to male/female and
> female/female pairing. This first set of observations is about pairing
> between males and females. Most of the answers from both males and
> females echoed words similar to those of Vera Peeters of tryx:
>
> Sorry, I do male-female (almost) all the time. I don\'t see what\'s
> special about it.
>
> Stephanie Ward of Interliant mentions that other issues are what is
> significant (such as personalities) but goes on to mention that in her
> experience some strong positives come out of the pairing because of
> different ways of approaching problems. We are not convinced that
> these differences are really gender related or related to other
> factors such as educational background. But in any case, her comments
> are highly relevant:
>
> This is an interesting balance to have, and it can cause problems
> depending on the personality types. The males on my team are pretty
> forceful with ideas and will tend to interrupt, while the females are
> less willing to interrupt and insist on their ideas. However, I have
> found males and females approach problems differently, which has
> always been a positive for me when working as a pair.
>
> As mentioned by Steve Hayes of Khatovar Technology Pty Ltd., gender
> issues can appear outside of pair programming:
>
> My first few months of pair programming were done in a male-female
> pair (I was the male). I\'ve also worked closely with women in the
> past. Everything went smoothly, and I didn\'t notice any issues. Later
> I worked as a coach with a team of five males, and we added a woman to
> the team. It was clear that there were issues. What still isn\'t clear
> to me is how much of these issues were gender based, and how many of
> them were just accounted for by the individual personalities without
> introducing gender. I have a sample of only one to work with! Here\'s
> my working model: In general, male programmers don\'t give as much
> credence to female programmers as they do to other males. The women
> feel ignored, and they either back down or become quite aggressive in
> pushing their views. In my group we tried to get everyone to listen
> better and be more respectful of opinions. Since this is what we
> needed to do regardless of whether our problem was gender based, we
> didn\'t pursue the gender issues any further.
>
> We conclude the discussion on male/female pairing with the comments

> there are other good things that might come out of pair programming:
>
> We got married, although I don\'t think it\'s a result of pair

### What This Is About

> In a manner similar to the concerns of the gender chapter, we are
> often asked the question, \"Does the cultural background of the pairs
> matter?\" For example, can someone from Germany work with someone from
> California? Can someone from the Orient work with someone from India?
> The bottom line is that cultural background does not matter as long as
> the pairs can communicate well---that is, both verbal and nonverbal
> communication. Since we have hit you over the head with the importance
> of communication, the fact that the key is communication is probably
> not surprising to you. All of the other issues discussed previously
> are what is important: the relative strength of the skills and
> experience brought to the table by each partner and the partners\'
> extrovert or introvert tendencies. Culture does not seem to have an
> effect on a successful pairing.
>
> We\'ve mentioned how pair programming and pair rotation enhance
> teamwork and communication. We\'ve found them to be particularly
> effective when it comes to learning about each other\'s culture and
> eliminating cultural barriers. Humans find comfort in being with
> others like themselves, hence the adage, \"Birds of a feather flock
> together.\" Unfortunately, this can lead to nonmalicious,
> nonintentional segregation. For example, there are many Indian
> students at North Carolina State University. You will generally find
> Indian students talking with other Indian students. The Indian
> students will know more Indian students in majors outside of Computer
> Science than do Computer Science students from the United States or
> other countries. Or, consider a programmer from China who joins a team
> of programmers in the United States. He may feel very alone,
> struggling with English as a second language. Pairing (and pair
> rotation) encourages us to build bridges and to draw everyone into
> \"the group.\" We can break down the nonmalicious, nonintentional
> segregation that tends to happen. When we sit next to each other for
> enough hours---we\'ll find out it\'s Chinese New Year that day---and
> that it\'s really not as hard to understand him talk as we thought it
> was. Or, someone will bring a special food from their country to
> share. Not only are cultural differences not an issue, they can be a
> means for learning and celebration.
>

### If There Are Problems

> It certainly is the case that there could be some sort of cultural
> bigotry that could exist in either partner. It is possible that
> pairing might make this kind of problem surface more quickly since the
> problem partner would be forced to interact very closely with his or
> her partner. Without the communication and respect that pairs should
> show for one another, the pairing would be doomed. Naturally bigotry
> should not be tolerated in any form. If pairing raises the issue
> sooner, then that is probably good. There is no place for bigotry in a
> collaborative environment, and if pairing helps to make this surface
> sooner, then so be it. The team will be much better off without the
> bigot.
>
> One of the important comments that is mentioned in many of the
> personal scenarios relate to what we\'ll call \"personal style.\"
> Issues, such as when one comes to work, how long one can work, how
> often and when breaks are taken, how long is spent on lunches, and so
> on, arise. In general, these are not true cultural differences; they
> are personal style issues. The solution is fairly easy but may be hard
> to implement. It requires that the programmers learn to be a bit more
> flexible and adapt to their partners---maybe taking fewer breaks or
> loosening up and actually taking a longer lunch hour to become more
> socially engaged with your partner.
>
> Discovering that these style issues exist requires that each partner
> spend a little time in self-evaluation of the pair and observe how
> well the pair is performing. Pretend that you are disembodied,
> floating around the cube, and be aware of what is happening. This will
> allow you to \"see\" what issues your pairing may be faced with and
> show you where you need to work to take corrective actions.
>
> Maybe the words of consultant Jim Murphy ring true:
>
> Canadians are the best programmers in the world (pair or otherwise),
> probably because we have no culture.
>

### Personal Scenarios

> Several of our personal comments suggest that culture really doesn\'t
> matter. The first comes from Ironring Software\'s Jim Murphy:
>
> My experience is that these factors may affect the rate of adoption or
> initial productivity, but once the ice is broken, these cultural
> issues are much less visible. Software is description, and we use
> metaphor to help us describe and talk about our descriptions. These
> metaphors are often culturally biased in a way that could make it
> tougher for a team to jell, at least until the team has created a
> microculture of its own.
>
> Christian Pekeler of CodeFab, Inc. concurs. He also mentions that
> culture is certainly an issue when interacting, but there is no place
> for it in pair programming.
>
> I\'m from Germany, working and pairing here in the United States with
> my colleagues which includes a developer from Japan. And I have also
> paired a little with someone from France. I do notice cultural
> differences every day. But none of these differences was or is
> specific to pair programming. Pair programming means interacting with
> a partner and therefore forces both to deal with their differences. It
> can be interesting, but it doesn\'t really matter whether these
> differences are of cultural origin.
>
> Professional programmer Jason Rogers provides supporting evidence for
> the language issue:
>
> I noticed a few problems in our team when people with very thick
> accents were paired with others who were not used to dealing with that
> on a regular basis. The partner with the thick accent would get
> frustrated trying to communicate, while the other got frustrated
> because the former couldn\'t communicate as well. This got better over
> time, as we all learned to \"interpret\" what the other was saying,
> but you can imagine that in the beginning it took quite a while to
> break down those communication barriers.
>
> Some comments from Lee Lichtenwalner who has spent a good deal of his
> career traveling around the world follows. He mentions that we should
> not be so naïve that we think that there are not cultural differences.
> He points out a number of observations of cultural phenomena that he
> believes can have some effect on pair programming. We agree that there
> are differences, but none so large that it really matters. When the
> pair is focused on solving a problem and meeting a deadline, that is
> their focus, and culture just isn\'t an important issue. Some of his
> examples include the following:
>
> The German culture is largely one of independence and high quality.
> While Germans work well in a team environment, they dislike situations
> in which they cannot stand out for their contributions to the team.
> Thus I am not sure they hate to pair, but they may dislike pairing if
> a certain level of recognition is not given to each individual as well
> as to the pair.
>
> Italians are a close-knit group with a level of intensity that makes
> most Americans uncomfortable. They have a strong tendency to sit close
> together in such a way that it invades the typical space bubble or
> comfort zone that Americans are used to.
>
> Indians (from India) tend to be focused narrowly on accomplishment and
> may dislike American methods of pair programming.... However, the
> American work ethic has a strong dislike for anything over 8--9 hours
> per day. By contrast, many Indians may thrive only after working
> 12--14 hours and feel like they have not contributed to the team by
> doing anything less.
>
> Kent Beck of Three Rivers Institute has observed that there are
> cultural issues, but they can be overcome by both partners working at
> building that pair relationship. The body space issue is how close the
> pairs sit when interacting. He has observed that some cultures are
> such that close, physical contact is how person-to-person interaction
> takes place, while others believe, more distance is important. Again,
> finding a mutually acceptable compromise is the key:
>
> Body space is only one of many cultural issues that enrich pairing. If
> I pair with someone from M.I.T., I expect to argue and fight and claw
> and push to get action. If I pair with someone from the Midwest, I
> have to draw out conflict. Some cultures talk about personal stuff
> before they talk about work. Others just start working.
>
> Several comments addressed the strong benefit from working with others
> with different backgrounds. Erik Bennerhult of the development firm
> Lejbrink Bennerhult describes how cultural diversity is a real benefit
> in the workplace:
>
> Actually, all this diversity was almost only beneficial. People had
> different ways of going about solving problems. People discussed in
> different ways. It was really good. It is my firm belief that
> diversity is good. I also believe that the current state of this
> business, with only white males from the same socio-economic group is
> one of the biggest problems in the industry.
>
> Professional programmer A. K. Molteni offers a highly insightful
> description of his cross-cultural experiences. What is fascinating is
> how one grows by way of these experiences:
>
> The cultural issues I encountered did not deal with the programming
> skill or the pair programming part. When I was part of it, we were
> both focused on making the best possible product. The culture issues
> happened outside of work. My work ethic is to get in earlier than most
> and start working. Taking breaks is kept to a minimum, but lunch
> breaks are always taken away from the workplace. Pair programming
> meant I would sometimes have to wait for my partner to show up in the
> morning. If my partner came in late, he or she would work through the
> lunch hour, which I wasn\'t keen on. My partner took longer breaks and
> took that time to socialize a lot more with other coworkers who were
> also taking a break. They would also stay late at night, but that\'s
> probably because we were all single. The married people kept to
> regular schedules. At first it was annoying but eventually we would
> come to a fine medium. My other group members would start coming in at
> a scheduled time so we knew we could expect them. We knew who had to
> go home when, and I started taking social breaks with them. We didn\'t
> let go of our own work ethics but incorporated the ones of
>
> others. It has made us that much more flexible. The best part of it
> all was we would understand and respect the coworkers more when they
> observed their religion/cultural activities (e.g., Lent, Ramadan, Holy

### Chapter 21. The Professional Driver Problem

> Pro Driver *(typing very fast)*: Ah, Grasshopper, if you can take the
> keyboard from my hand, then you will be the master.
>
> Grasshopper *(reaches for the keyboard)*
>
> Pro Driver *(deftly moving the keyboard to the left while still
> typing)*: You must be much quicker than that, Grasshopper.
>
> Grasshopper *(observes the typing and tries a feint to the right and a
> grab from the left)* Pro Driver *(grabs the keyboard by the escape key
> and lifts it up three inches)* Grasshopper *(gets nothing but air)*:
> Damn!
>
> Pro Driver *(typing even faster now, using her elbows)*: Grasshopper,
> that is the oldest trick in
>
> the book.
>
> Grasshopper *(excitedly points)*: Hey, look at what Jerry left on his
> monitor!
>
> Pro Driver *(expertly typing with her feet)*: Grasshopper, no, I was
> mistaken*t*,*hat* is the oldest trick in the book.
>

### Root Causes

> The desire for power, a driver\'s lack of confidence in the navigator,
> a navigator\'s lack of confidence in him- or herself.
>
> Note: A professional driver pairing may not be a problem if the driver
> is compensating for a physical or temporary limitation of his or her
> partner.
>

### General Form

> Our problem child is always at the keyboard. Some individuals and some
> teams have been hurt by a bad professional driver. Let\'s chat about
> this \"bad\" professional driver. Professional drivers will not give
> up control of the keyboard. This makes the navigator feel disjointed,
> out of the loop, or unimportant. The problem is even worse when
> professional drivers seem to be unwilling to listen very much (or at
> all) to the navigator. This is a serious breakdown and jeopardizes the
> success of the pairing.
>
> It can also be the case that the navigator may feel uncomfortable
> driving and has become a professional navigator. Usually this is a
> lack of confidence in one or more of his or her own \"driving\"
> skills.
>
> Sometimes a person becomes a \"good\" professional driver because it
> is genuinely in the best interest of the pair and the team. His or her
> partner may be an extremely slow typist or have RSI (like Martin Griss
> in[Chapter](#chapter-12.-expert-expert-pairing)
> [12](#chapter-12.-expert-expert-pairing) on expert-expert
> pairs) or some other handicap. The good professional driver will
> willingly interact with the navigator, and the pairing can work quite
> well.
>
> Another beneficial professional driving pattern can legitimately
> occur, but only temporarily. If you are close to a critical deadline,
> you may not have time for the navigator to learn a new development
> tool.
>

### Refactored Solution

> In the Personal Scenarios that follow we discuss many different means
> (sometimes highly physical) to get the keyboard away from the driver.
> However, the best solution is to help the professional driver learn to
> give up control---to help the driver learn to be a navigator. This can
> be unbelievably difficult because the driver may be a control freak or
> feel insecure without the keyboard. He or she may not have the
> patience required to sit back and watch a less-skilled programmer at
> work. The best solution might be to have the professional driver watch
> a good navigator working with a partner, see the interactions, and
> hopefully learn how pair programming must be done. Unfortunately, if
> the professional driver can not be trained, then it is probably best
> to not use that person in a pair programming situation.
>
> In the case of professional navigators, they must force themselves to
> take control and do some driving so they can improve their skill sets.
> If that doesn\'t happen, the \"innocent\" professional driver should
> insist that turns be taken. Naturally, the good professional driver
> will willingly give up the controls and try to help the navigator
> become more skilled.
>
> If you see yourself as a professional driver or a professional
> navigator, get over it!
>
> The driver compensating for a handicap of his or her partner does not
> need to refactor the solution. Indeed, by being a professional driver,
> the programmer can help the navigator achieve more than ever before.
> Laurie remembers a brilliant student at the University of Utah who had
> a horrible car accident and lost motor skills in his hands. He had
> braces put on his arms that let him type one letter at a time, with
> great difficulty. His partner benefited greatly from the pairing
> because of the navigator\'s brilliant mind. The navigator benefited
> because he was able to use this brilliant mind without being
> physically hampered. Together they were a winning pair in every way.
>

### Personal Scenarios

> Interestingly, several of our survey respondents admitted to being a
> professional driver. To protect them, we have not included their
> names. We even had one respondent admit that he was a slow typist and
> preferred to work with a professional driver. Here are some of the
> respondent\'s comments:
>
> I haven\'t had experience with professional drivers, but maybe people
> who have worked with me might complain about it.
>
> Oh! Oh, you are talking about me! I can do that sometimes especially
> with an introvert or someone that doesn\'t type fast enough or isn\'t
> accustomed to the development environment. We just aren\'t moving fast
> enough sometimes, and it can be frustrating.
>
> As you might imagine, some respondents claimed that it never happened
> to them because they were just too tough. We particularly liked what
> Ron Jeffries of ObjectMentor had to say:
>
> Nobody screws with me. I\'m the XP Hammer.
>
> However, professional driving is a very serious problem for pair
> programming as described in the following from a professional
> programmer who wishes to remain anonymous:
>
> I paired with an application \"hero\" who was the recognized expert in
> the application. I was the average one. He drove all of the time and
> was an extremely fast typist. I spent most of my time looking over his
> shoulder and watching him program. Most of the time he was completely
> silent. Fortunately, I am an experienced developer, so I could
> recognize most of what he was doing. Unfortunately, without his
> commentary, I was so wrapped up in keeping up with understanding his
> code that I never had a chance to contribute to the design of the
> code. Whenever I asked about his design, the answers were terse and
> sometimes monosyllabic.
>
> Stephanie Ward of Interliant describes how drivers may actually
> exhibit some \"hermit\" characteristics:
>
> This is a very difficult problem to solve. I once worked with a driver
> where we always worked at his machine. He always drove, and therefore
> his ideas were always tried first when there was a disagreement. He
> liked to discuss an idea/implementa-tion first and plot out the
> roadmap of how to proceed, but when it came time actually to code the
> solution, he would have been happier coding alone.
>
> Finally, Jeff Canna of RoleModel Software states that professional
> drivers are just lousy partners---period:
>
> I\'ve never had a problem with this as long as the driver who
> wouldn\'t give up was listening to me. The time I\'ve had an issue
> with this is when the person who \"needs\" to drive is
>
> ignoring me; being the passenger in this case gets really old really
> fast. I\'ve also found if people are insistent drivers, they tend not
> to be a good pair, and I do not like pairing with them.
>
> We had many suggestions on how to solve the problem of the
> professional driver. Some as, mentioned earlier, simply gave up on the
> partner. Tim Mackinnon of Connextra says:
>
> This is incredibly boring; it\'s like watching paint dry. You don\'t
> learn the same as if you grab the keyboard. We watch for this and
> instruct such people to work on relinquishing control. The flip side
> of this is that sometimes someone is too timid to take control. We try
> and help people build confidence and also try and do outrageous things
> to get a reaction that causes the person to grab the keyboard.
>
> A particularly poignant comment from professional programmer Anders
> Bengtsson describes how a little assertive behavior works, but
> sometimes you have to be aggressively assertive:
>
> This is a real problem, because if you pressure them to give up the
> keyboard, they will lose their interest and be of no help to you when
> you drive. I think it\'s important that both know how PP is supposed
> to work, so giving up the keyboard won\'t be a cause of conflict.
>
> Keywords like \"let me drive\" may be helpful. I have also had the
> keyboard snapped from my hands with an angry \"you\'ve been at the
> keyboard all day\" yelled. It was somewhat comical, but it taught me
> that you have to offer the keyboard regularly, since not everyone will
> find it easy to ask for it.
>
> On a (probably) less serious note, Michael Lindner of Sonus Networks

>
> Finally, Markus Pfister of Itopia uses some good common sense. Make

> Team *(gathered around the espresso machine chatting)*
>
> Fred *(looking down the hall at Barney*:*)* Loser! Rest of team
> (*totally shocked*)
>
> Barney *(speaking softly)*: Hey, Fred, time to get back at it.
>
> Fred *(doesn\'t respond, walks to their station, sits down as the
> driver, starts typing)*: Mutter, mutter, mutter.
>
> Barney *(pointing)*: You can\'t use that class; it doesn\'t have the
> correct iterator type. Fred *(impatiently ignores Barney)*: Mutter,

### Root Causes

> Usually some kind of attitude problem. Often it has nothing to do with
> the partner; the person just feels that he or she is better than
> anyone else.
>

### General Form

> Recognizing this problem is sometimes quite easy. When the partner
> comes stomping away from the station, screaming that he or she will
> never pair again, you should have a pretty good indication that there
> is a problem. *(Note: Smoke, fire, and yelling are other good
> indications.)* A little digging and you will certainly uncover that
> one of the partners has an excess ego problem. Sometimes the person
> with the excess ego intimidates his or her partner so much that it is
> more difficult to spot. Or if the partner has some tendency toward
> being introverted, again it may be difficult to discern. However,
> switching partners will eventually lead to someone who \"just can\'t
> take it anymore\" and the ego issue will be found out.
>
> Finally, we are reminded of the management technique, \"Management by
> Walking Around\" (MBWA) and its sibling \"Management by Walking Around
> and Listening.\" MBWA is a more open technique where the manager
> frequently wanders around, talking with the team members, encouraging
> them, offering advice, and so on. (Note: One has to be careful not to
> overdo MBWA as it could come off as being overbearing, micromanaging,
> or \"too much in your face.\") The manager who is using MBWA should be
> able to spot the excess ego problem after observing the pair working.
> Observing the interactions, watching the body language, and in general
> interpreting how well the pair is pairing should help to tip off the
> manager that there is a problem.
>

### Refactored Solution

> Clearly this is a serious issue and must be dealt with as quickly as
> possible. The psyche and cohesion of the entire team are at risk. An
> amazing number of people in the Personal Scenarios indicate that they
> have no tolerance for the excess ego problem, and the best solution is
> to fire the individual. Excess ego is not to be tolerated. We have
> heard of people who try to solve this problem by pairing the egomaniac
> with someone who is definitely far superior. The hope is that it will
> help cut down the person\'s ego and provide some humility.
>
> Usually this doesn\'t work as the person often has the mindset:
> \"Well, he was great, but the rest of them are losers!!\" Another
> technique is to go through several pairings with known, good partners
> and show how valuable pair programming is and how effective it can be.
> The hope is that the egomaniac will see the benefit and learn that all
> partners can contribute to a successful pairing. Again, sometimes this
> works for a while, but as soon as the individual is paired with
> someone he or she needs to teach or work with, the old egomaniac
> issues surface, and the problem is back.
>
> Counseling and working with and teaching the individual to keep his or
> her ego in check can be effective. As with many other problems, one of
> the most important issues is for the individual to admit that there
> indeed is a problem. Then, the person has to work harder when pairing
> to keep his or her own ego in check and learn to work with the partner
> no matter what the partner\'s particular skill level may be. This can
> work, but it takes an individual who can exhibit self-control and who
> wants to improve.
>
> Alas, however, there may be no constructive way to solve the problem.
> You may be forced to relegate the person to doing individual
> programming tasks (although this does have the downside that unless
> the individual is producing code that is not used by anyone else, the
> person will eventually be interacting with other team members and his
> or her bad attitude would likely still cause problems). If that does
> not work then the individual is just going to have to leave.
>

### Personal Scenarios

> Professional programmer Norman Rekitt observes that attitude is an
> important key to successful pair programming:
>
> It is a fight with this one. Attitide is everything.
>
> We concur and add that we believe that attitude is in general
> important for pretty much all things related to being a successful
> member of any software development project. Consultant Wayne Conrad,
> who confesses that he has egomaniac tendencies, offers the advice that
> if you recognize your problems, you can overcome them and create a
> happy, effective pairing:
>
> My ego makes me take control when pairing, whether I\'m in the front
> or in the back. That makes pairing a difficult exercise in humility.
>
> Omnigon International\'s Peter Merel also offers some advice on how to
> correct the problem of excess ego:
>
> Some folk just aren\'t cut out for development teams. In particular, I
> worked with one fellow who became politically active whenever he
> worked with others---just downright antisocial toward them. His skills
> weren\'t awful, but he was a habitual team-wrecker. There was no way
> to cut him from the team, so we simply let him sit in his own little
> world, and we developed around him. Most folks with ego problems,
> however, are reachable. The best way is to get them to see pairing as
> a goal, something for which to demonstrate prowess. If you can do
> that, then they work to boost their egos by getting good at it.
>
> Several described what eventually happened to the egomaniacs. Most, as
> you can see, were eliminated from their positions, in one way or

>

### Root Causes

> This seems to happen when someone simply has zero confidence in his or
> her own skill and feels inadequate in accomplishing even the most
> basic task. Often it is even worse when paired with someone with
> better skills.
>

### General Form

> This ego problem is often readily apparent. Nearly any partner who
> pairs with the individual will most likely notice it immediately and
> will be able to report it to the manager. In addition, any manager who
> observes the pair at work will certainly be able to pick up on the
> issue. It is also true that this problem can be more subtle. People
> who seriously lack confidence have often learned techniques to hide
> it; they are often exceedingly quiet. When they\'re questioned, they
> use techniques to turn the conversation around so they are asking the
> questions and trying to get opinions from others.
>

### Refactored Solution

> Clearly there are deep psychological issues that would have to be
> overcome in the most severe cases. However, for the remainder, there
> are several possible solutions. One of the keys is to let the person
> who lacks confidence drive. Since the driver has a very focused task
> to complete, it forces the person without good
>
> self-confidence to be much more active. Pairing that person with a
> partner who has good people skills will also be a great benefit. The
> navigator can work to complement the driver for each good idea and
> good execution of their task. This will help build up his or her
> confidence and self-esteem. The key is to make sure that the
> complements are not overdone and they are true and genuine. Overdoing
> the compliments is disingenuous and certainly can make the task of
> helping the person improve his or her self-confidence even more
> difficult.
>
> When the person with low confidence is the navigator, again, the
> partner can work to help overcome the problem. As the team is working,
> if one partner is not interacting, the other can work to draw him or
> her out by asking questions and asking for advice. Another good
> technique is to introduce as much comedy and mirth as possible. Try to
> lighten up the situation and make the other person feel comfortable.
> Tell a joke (not a stupid joke, unless it is so stupid that it is
> funny). Make fun of the program; talk about one funny thing that
> happened the day before. Eventually the communication will increase,
> which ultimately will lead you down the path toward a better working
> relationship and getting your partner to open up and instill more
> self-confidence. Clearly it takes patience, but the reward can be a
> vastly improved colleague. It is also the case that not anyone can
> take on the role of mentor, teacher, and advisor. It takes someone
> with the right people skills and a high level of
>
> self-confidence.
>
> One problem that can surface is team members feeling that the \"lack
> of ego\" person is not pulling his or her weight. This can cause
> heartaches for the rest of the team. They may perceive that since one
> person isn\'t working as hard as the rest, why should they be pulling
> all-nighters and putting in the long hours. This can be an infectious
> problem and clearly must be addressed.
>
> Another problem that could arise is \"flipping the bozo bit.\" The

### Chapter 24. Pair Programming in a Software Process Case Study: Extreme Programming (XP)

> This chapter describes a disciplined, agile software development
> methodology, Extreme Programming (XP) (Auer and Miller 2001, Beck
> 2000, Beck and Fowler 2001, Jeffries et al. 2001). After describing
> XP, we\'ll give our views on why pair programming is an integral part
> of realizing success with an XP project.
>

### A Life-Cyle Evolution

> In the evolution of software development methodologies, first came the
> code-and-fix model. People were simply using computers to \"find the
> answer,\" to perform computation that took too long to do \"by
> hand.\"For this type of development, code-and-fix was fine. (The fact
> that is it still in wide use today is worrisome, though.)
>
> Code-and-fix can be classified as ad hoc, meaning that the methods
> used are tailored to the situation or problem at hand and are not
> necessarily applicable to any other situation or problem.
>
> Then came the waterfall process. This process was first published in
> 1970 by Winton Royce. Royce broke the software development process
> into five steps: requirements definition, system and software design,
> implementation and unit testing, integration and system testing, and
> operation and maintenance. A key to the waterfall process is that a
> step had to be done perfectly because once a step was done, it was
> never revisited. All future development used the artifacts of previous
> steps without looking back. Many organizations have graduated from
> code-and-fix to the waterfall model. However, current thinking says
> the \"never look back\" policy is not advisable, especially when
> requirements are rapidly changing. (Actually, Royce\'s original work
> did have feedback loops to earlier steps. A simplification of his
> model ultimately became the legendary waterfall model.)
>
> The shortcomings of the waterfall model motivated the spiral model. In
> 1988, Boehm proposed the spiral development model, which essentially
> said that the first two steps of the waterfall model (requirements
> definition and system and software design) would still be done for the
> whole project. Then the next two (implementation and unit testing and
> integration and system testing) would be done iteratively. That is,
> the programmers would be assigned pieces of the designed system and
> would work on the implementation, integration, and testing for that
> piece. When that piece was integrated and tested, the programmers
> would be assigned another piece. This was a big improvement over the
> waterfall model because smaller pieces could be completed and
> integrated, making the process much more manageable. Certain
> development processes based on this model also allowed for customers
> to give feedback on groups of these smaller chunks of functionality,
> often called *increments* or *releases*. (Sometimes this led to doing
> the fifth step, operation and maintenance, incrementally.) Current
> perspectives on the spiral model are that the detailed completion of
> the first two steps, requirements and design, led to unresponsive
> projects because they did not change the project requirements or
> design based on any midstream customer feedback.
>

### Along Comes XP

> These shortcomings motivated the originators of XP (Kent Beck, Ward
> Cunningham, and Ron Jeffries) to create XP. All five of waterfall\'s
> steps are done incrementally and often. The main benefit of doing this
> is to be as agile as possible to requirements changes while still
> managing cost and schedule. We will describe XP in the context of
> waterfall\'s five steps. With XP, these five steps are done highly
> iterative. Developers quite often cycle several times between design,
> implementation, and testing in the course of an hour\'s work.

### Requirements Definition

> Requirements are gathered and scheduled employing user stories and the
> release planning process. To begin, customers work with developers or
> requirements analysts to gather requirements. This is done very
> informally. A customer speaks about a requirement, and the developer
> writes down the requirement on an index card, almost verbatim, in the
> customer\'s own language. There is no intent to specify completely the
> customer\'s requirement on the index card. The card is a commitment
> for future conversation between the developer and the customer. When
> all the cards are done, the customer is asked to prioritize these user
> stories (or requirements).
>
> The developers then work with the stories. They read the stories and
> ask questions of an on-site customer about what is desired. From this,
> the developers estimate how long the story will take to implement. If
> a story is too big (that is, it would take longer than a week to
> complete), the customer is asked to break the story into smaller
> stories. To come up with the estimate, the developers look at how long
> it has taken them to complete other similar stories. They also assess
> the risk associated with the story.
>
> With each story card having a description, a priority, a resource
> estimate, and a risk assessment, Release Planning (often known as the
> \"Planning Game\") is performed, using these cards as the playing
> pieces. The \"game\" is played by laying all the cards on the table
> and sliding, rearranging, and reorganizing them. The object of the
> game is to decide which stories get implemented in the next release,
> trying to maximize the number of high-priority stories. With XP, a
> release is generally no more than three months long, which results in
> a program that delivers functionality to the customer. Each release is
> broken into three or four iterations (a three-week period) and results
> in an internal development deliverable. At the end of each iteration,
> the team assesses the stories they have been able to complete and
> makes a new plan for the successful completion of the release (perhaps
> involving a new, smaller Release Plan to reset the Release Plan based
> on actual results). At the end of Release Planning, the team knows
> which stories will be done in the next iteration.
>
> Developers sign up to implement the user stories. One developer is the
> owner of each story. All work is done in pairs and the story owner
> recruits a partner to work with on each subtask, based on the
> technical aspects of that particular subtask.
>
> While the story is being implemented, many questions will arise. With
> XP, it is very important to have an on-site customer representative to
> clarify these requirements at any time. XP practitioners believe that
> many problems
>
> arise because requirements are not completely or accurately specified
> or because the developers simply don\'t understand the requirement. An
> on-site customer can clarify the requirements, which will prevent the
> developer from having to make many assumptions on what the customer
> probably wanted.
>
> Another important job of the on-site customer is to work with the
> developers to create acceptance (or functional) test cases. They
> define what kinds of things they want to see the system do in order to
> feel assured that a user story has been properly implemented. In
> developing these test cases, the customer also clarifies his or her
> requirements.
>
> In traditional development, the customer and the requirements analysts
> work to define a detailed, consistent, correct, and verifiable
> document that describes what the customer wants. This becomes a
> contract of what needs to be delivered. Conversely, with XP the
> developers do not seek to understand requirements completely until
> they really need to. They gain this understanding in real time by
> talking to the customer (discussions over documents) and by reviewing
> acceptance test cases. In this way the customer and the developer gain
> understanding of desirable functionality later in the process---once
> they both have more knowledge of the capabilities of the current
> system and of the domain/problem to be solved.
>
> Once a release has been completed and delivered to the customer,
> Release Planning is redone to determine which user stories will be
> implemented in the next release. At this time the customer has ample
> opportunity to change the priorities and the stories themselves.

### System and Software Design

> XP does not produce big design documents before getting started.
> XP\'ers call this BDUF for \"big design up front\" and believe that
> the development of these documents is not cost-effective. The idea
> here is that software engineers change their minds about how they will
> implement something once they try it and once they get feedback on
> completed work. If you skip the documentation step, you will start
> producing software assets that have value to your customer, not just
> to your documents. Surely there will be rework and refactoring because
> of the lack of up-front design, but there will be less time spent
> reworking and refactoring than would have gone into the BDUF. In
> addition, you will have assets, not paper. After a release is
> completed, some XP teams also create some bare-bones documentation
> that records what they *did do,* not what they *planned* to do. Of
> course, if the customer writes a story concerned with the need for
> documentation and assigns the priority of it high enough to make it
> into a release, documentation will be created to suit the customer\'s
> desires.
>
> In traditional development, a system architecture is developed to
> provide a map of how all the pieces fit together. The closest that XP
> comes to that is the system metaphor. For example, in the original XP
> project, the C3 project was a payroll system. The metaphor that was
> used was an assembly line. As a paycheck went down the assembly line,
> it was given all the pieces of information it needed. When it got to
> the end of the assembly line, it had all of the necessary information.
> All the developers on the C3 project had the assembly-line mental
> model in their heads, which helped them to visualize how all the
> pieces fit together. \"The metaphor gives the team a consistent
> picture they can use to describe the way the existing system works,
> where new parts fit, and what form they should take\" (Auer and Miller
> 2001).
>
> In general, when a pair starts to work on a story, they read the story
> and do whatever they need to do to feel comfortable that they can
> handle it. This may be an impromptu CRC card session (Beck and
> Cunningham 1989, Bellin and Simone 1997), or it may be to write down a
> quick diagram on a white board. The pair uses any
>
> tools and technique that any other software developer might use to
> devise a design; however, they use only what they feel is necessary to
> tackle the task at hand. The artifacts of this process---the notes,
> cards, and diagrams---are never officially archived for future use.
> Once the pair feels comfortable that they have a good view of their
> direction, they begin to code.
>
> A very important part of XP\'s design philosophy is \"do the simplest
> thing that could possibly work\" and the \"You Aren\'t Gonna Need It\"
> (YAGNI) philosophy. The XP premises emphasize sticking to the user
> story at hand.
>
> Doing anything else is speculative, at best, and requires us to assume
> we know what the customer wants. These XP premises run counter to
> traditional software engineering doctrine concerning the Cost of
> Change curve (Boehm 1981). The traditional Cost of Change curve
> indicates that the later change enters the development cycle, the
> exponentially more expensive it is. XP proponents contend that its
> practices flatten the Cost of Change curve (Beck 2000) and that late
> change is not (much) more expensive. The time saved by not producing
> BDUF and plans is more than the required reword to handle change later
> in the development cycle.
>
> The last thing to mention, as far as XP design goes, is refactoring,
> the technique of improving code without changing its functionality.
> Martin Fowler has championed this technique (Fowler et al. 1999). The
> first pass on the code is to do the simplest thing that could possibly
> work to get the user story running. Then pairs refactor in the process
> of implementing more functionality, or there is an explicit,
> deliberate time where the pair refactors code in order to improve the
> design of their working, functional implementation.

### Code Implementation and Unit Testing

> Before the pair writes a single line of production code, they write
> their first automated unit test case. The programmer cycles through
> tight \"create a few test cases\"/ \" write a bit of code\" cycles. In
> object-oriented code, this means they write unit tests for every
> method they plan to implement. These tests show that the method works
> as intended and handles error conditions gracefully. Naturally, since
> the code has not been written, these test cases will initially fail.
> The pair then writes just enough code to make these test cases
> succeed. As more and more functionality is properly implemented, more
> and more test cases will pass. The job is not done until both the
> functionality for the user story is completed, and 100 percent of the
> unit tests are successful. One hundred percent of the unit test cases
> that were ever written for the entire product must also pass. Only
> then can the developer know that the new functionality was
> successfully implemented without breaking anything else in the
> project.
>
> The entire development team owns the entire code base (called
> \"Collective Code Ownership\"). This means that any pair can change
> any line of code in the entire code base in order to add functionality
> or to refactor. The pair does not need to ask permission of the author
> of that section. They just have to make sure that all the unit tests
> ever written on the code base still run successfully.
>
> Last, because of pair programming and collective code ownership, each
> XP project has commenting guidelines and follows a coding standard.
> This is necessary because everyone on the team needs to be able to
> understand anyone else\'s code to enhance it or refactor it quickly.
> However, the commenting emphasis is to have self-documenting or
> self-revealing code rather than too many comments (which might become
> out-of-date or obsolete).
>
> A common trend in modern software development is to integrate often.
> XP practices \"Continuous Integration,\" whereby pairs put new
> functionality (code changes and the newly written unit test cases)
> under source control
>
> in the code base as soon as all the unit test cases pass. This happens
> at the end of every pairing session. The pair will have run 100
> percent of the unit test cases for the system, and all of them will
> have passed before integration.

### Acceptance Testing

> Acceptance testing is done using the test cases developed and agreed
> on by the customer. These tests are used to measure the progress of
> system development (in terms of either the absolute number or the
> percentage of test cases that pass). They make a statement of how much
> functionality has been properly implemented in the system. It is
> always good to automate these tests, too, so that it is easy to tell
> if any new functionality breaks any functional test cases that had
> previously passed.
>

### XP Needs Pair Programming

> We believe pair programming is an integral part of XP, and it is
> dangerous to do XP without doing pair programming. One primary reason
> is that the pairs keep each other honest. XP is a minimalist approach,
> so it is essential that many of the practices actually get done. The
> various practices have checks and balances on each other. Alistair
> Cockburn classifies XP as a \"high discipline\" process because it is
> very important that the developers follow the practices, however
> minimal they are. In *Agile Software Development* (2001), Cockburn
> says the following about XP:
>
> \[It\] is a high-discipline methodology...it calls for tight adherence
> to strict coding and design standards, very strong unit test suites
> that must pass at all times, good acceptance tests, constant work in
> pairs, vigilance in keeping the design simple, and aggressive
> refactoring.... It turns out that most people *like* working in pairs.
> Programming in pairs plays to their pride in work, since they get more
> done in less time, with fewer errors, and usually end up with a better
> design. They like this. As a result, they program in pairs
> voluntarily. While in pairs, they encourage each other to follow
> coding standards and write tests so the discipline is kept in place by
> the paired programming.
>
> In this respect, pair programming is highly beneficial because the
> pair-pressure aspects of pairing cause people to be more likely
> actually to follow the practices. If developers don\'t really feel
> like writing good unit test cases, they might do it anyway because
> they are too embarrassed to skip them with their partner watching.
> Navigators can also identify problems with coding standards and
> comments. Drivers are much more likely to ensure the code is, indeed,
> simple and self-documenting, lest they fear the perpetual navigator
> question, \"Can you tell me what you are doing?\"
>
> Last, since no formal design is ever done, it is wonderful for the
> pair to devise the design on-the-fly together---an impromptu CRC card
> session, perhaps? Together, they are assured of producing a better
> design than either could have produced alone.

### Chapter 25. Pair Programming in a Software Process Case Study: Collaborative Software Process (CSP)

> The previous chapter described an agile software development
> methodology, Extreme Programming (XP). Now we will briefly describe
> another methodology, the Collaborative Software Process (CSP). CSP is
> a process specifically designed to leverage the power of pair
> programmers. Elements of CSP have been taken from XP (Auer and Miller
> 2001; Beck 2000; Jeffries et al. 2001) and from Watts Humphrey\'s
> Personal Software Process (PSP) (1995). Laurie created the CSP and
> documented it in her dissertation (2000).
>
> The purpose of this chapter is two-fold. Most important, it is to show
> that almost any proven process can be adapted to incorporate pair
> programing. The process can realize all the benefits of pair
> programming (higher quality, reduced cycle time, and so on) to make it
> even better. Mark Paulk of the SEI reflects on the ability of pair
> programming to fulfill the CMM Level 3 requirement of peer reviews,
> \"Pair programming addresses peer reviews and is arguably more
> powerful than many peer review techniques because it adopts preventive
> concepts found in code reading and literate programming\" (2001).
> (Paulk also indicates that more empirical research is necessary before
> declaring pair programming a substitute for peer review. We agree, as
> we discuss in the next chapter.)
>
> Second, the purpose of this chapter is to provide the documentation
> for a second process that incorporates pair programming. Humphrey
> specifically designed PSP so that individual software engineers had
> procedures to address all the key process areas of Capability Maturity
> Model (CMM) of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) (Paulk et al.
> 1993). As a result, CSP does likewise.
>
> In 1998, Karl Weigers published an essay, \"Read My Lips: No New
> Process Models\" (1998). He says the following:
>
> ...The software industry does not need any more models right now. We
> don\'t need a lot of new formalisms for software development, new
> design methods, new life-cycle approaches, new frameworks for process
> improvement, or new quality models.... What we do need is for
> practitioners routinely and effectively to apply the techniques
> defined by our existing models and frameworks. Once we\'ve reached the
> practical limit of these approaches, we can turn to improved models
> that provide guidance for working in better ways.
>
> The purpose of this chapter is not necessarily to throw another
> process in the ring, but to demonstrate again how the practice of pair
> programming is beneficial to almost any process---to help
> practitioners routinely and effectively apply the techniques of pair
> programming in their desired process.
>

### CSP Overview

> The CSP is an extension of the PSP, and it relies on the foundation of
> the PSP. The CSP incorporates the evolutionary learning approach of
> PSP, whereby engineers implementing the CSP gradually learn to
> incorporate the techniques into their own process. CSP has three focus
> areas. New users of the CSP start at Focus Area 0, incorporate quality
> management techniques in Focus Area 1, and follow with project
> management techniques at Focus Area 2. As we describe each of these
> Focus Areas, we CSP with XP and PSP.

### Focus Area 0: Baselining Your Process

> In the CSP, work is done in pairs. In Focus Area 0, pairs of engineers
> continue to use their \"natural\" process, producing the artifacts
> they\'ve typically produced. The purpose of this level is to get used
> to working in pairs and to provide baseline measurements that can be
> compared with results of future process improvements. We want to know
> if adding steps to our process to improve quality or productivity
> actually works. If it doesn\'t work, then why even bother? The only
> way really to know if we\'re getting better is to measure ourselves.
>
> So engineers record how much time they spend on their tasks. They also
> record info about the defects they remove from their programs when
> they do things like reviews or testing. It\'s good to record this
> information based on the phase of the development cycle. Then you can
> see all kinds of interesting facts, for example, you barely spend any
> time in design, but you spend 75 percent of your time in test (could
> it be that if you had a better design you could get through test
> easier?). Or, you might see that when you pair program, you spend 1
> percent of your time getting a clean compile, but when you program
> alone, you end up spending 5 percent of your time getting a clean
> compile. Admittedly, recording this data will feel like a hassle, but
> it does provide great information to help you be the best (pair)
> programmer you can be. It also lets you keep good historical data that
> you can use later to make achievable commitments so you don\'t
> overcommit yourself. Last, it will help you as you constructively
> interact with your boss on your past project performance and the
> relationship of past history to future commitments. We\'ll talk more
> about that in Focus Area 2.
>
> PSP definitely does this software process data collection and
> analysis. XP doesn\'t really, although informal recording of the total
> time spent on each task is often done and used for future estimation.
> PSP\'s time-tracking procedures specify that the time spent in each
> development phase (design, design review, code, and so on) is recorded
> to the minute. CSP advocates a quick cycling through the design, code,
> compile, and test phases as functionality is added to the system. As a
> result, it is hard to record the time spent in each phase. We believe
> it is important to record and understand the total time spent on each
> task and to understand the percentage of \"new development\" and
> \"rework\" time. New development time is when some sort of
> asset---like code or tests--- is being produced for the first time.
> Rework time is when the the quality of assets is being improved, via
> debugging or getting test cases to pass. So CSP focuses on tracking
> the total time spent, divided into new development and rework phases.
>
> A very important thing that happens in Level 0 is engineers learn to
> work in pairs. Most programmers have
>
> been conditioned to work individually; switching to collaborative
> programming is certainly an adjustment. Many engi-neers venture into
> their first pair programming experience skeptical that they would
> actually benefit from collaborative work. They wonder about
> coordinating schedules and the added communication that will be
> required; about adjusting to the other\'s working habits, programming
> style, and ego; and about disagreeing on aspects of the
> implementation.
>
> The adjustment period to pair programming sometimes happens
> instantaneously. Often it takes hours or days, depending on the
> individuals. A major milestone occurs when a newbie loses the instinct
> or the inhibition to tear the keyboard out of his or her partner\'s
> hands (depending on the partner\'s temperament). It also takes a while
> for a programmer to learn to leverage the power of the person sitting
> next to him or her---to know when to ask for help and to know how to
> accept help graciously. It also takes a while to learn how to help the
> driver constructively without feeling as if you are correcting or
> criticizing. It does not take many victorious, clean compiles or
> declarations of \"We just got through our test with no defects!\" for
> the teams to celebrate their union---and to feel like one jelled,
> collaborative team.
>
> So, people getting started with CSP learn how to record basic time and
> defect information, and they learn how to work together as a pair.
> Next, in Focus Area 1, they learn some techniques intended to help
> them more predictably produce high-quality projects.

### Focus Area 1: Quality Management

> As we said, the engineers start to add specific techniques to improve
> their chances of predictably producing high-quality code. Quite
> possibly, the engineer\'s baseline process already requires him or her
> to do some of these techniques; then, of course, no change is
> required.
>
> The first of these techniques is to understand your requirements by
> preparing use cases. The first step in developing the use cases is to
> identify the actors, the people or systems that are external to the

>
> PSP does not advocate any particular way of discovering classes.
> Extreme Programmers don\'t always do CRC cards, but a pair might kick
> off an impromptu CRC card session at any time to help them get started
> on a design for a user story.
>
> CSP also focuses on writing unit tests and black box, or functional,
> tests. Black box/functional test cases are written early---in the
> design stage, or even earlier, in the requirements analysis stage. The
> philosophy behind this is that if you diabolically think about \"how
> can I break this code\" and write test cases to see if you have or
> not, you will design and code in order to pass the test cases. Writing
> and reviewing these test cases can also help you understand your
> requirements or cause you to ask customers questions so you can
> understand them. An often ignored, but very important, reason to write
> test cases early is that when a project is in the chaotic throes of
> testing with a deadline looming, the development of a complete set of
> test cases is often compromised and/or not done. The lack of a
> thorough set of test cases can have a debilitating effect on the
> quality of a software project.
>
> PSPers write test cases, but not until after code has been written. In
> most software development processes, engineers author a contractual
> requirements specification. In comparison, XP developers work with
> customers to develop high-level acceptance test cases, which certainly
> helps to clarify requirements. When these test cases run successfully,
> the User Story is deemed contractually satisfied.
>
> Another practice of CSP to improve quality is to create incrementally
> an extensive, automated set of white box test cases. A small chunk of
> functionality is chosen for implementation. Test cases are written for
> this chunk before code is written. Then code is written, and the test
> cases (and all the other test cases that were ever written on the
> code) are run. The new code is done when all the test cases are
> passed. This iterative process of \"design-a-little, write-some-test
> cases, code-a-little, test-a-little\" allows development to proceed
> with confidence that the code is correct. It also improves defect
> removal efficiency because if a test case fails, the engineer can be
> assured that the new code caused the fault.
>
> Again, PSPers write test cases, but not until after code has been
> written. CSP adopted XP\'s unit testing techniques and philosophy.
>
> The last CSP technique for focusing on quality is the analysis of
> measurements. As we said in Focus Area 0, engineers started recording
> information about the time they spent and the defects they removed.
> Now this data is turned into significantly more information in order
> to provide measurement-based feedback. By analyzing the measurements,
> engineers can learn about how they work. For example, they can see
>
> - The percentage of time they spend in
> new development versus rework phases.
>
> - Where they remove most of their
> defects. If they are removing syntax defects in the compile phase, is
> the navigator daydreaming or asleep on the job?
>
> - What kinds of defects they remove
> during functional test. If they have many functional test defects, how
> can they adjust their pair process so this doesn\'t happen anymore?
>
> - Where in the process they are most
> error prone. How can they adjust their process to be less error prone
> and more careful during this phase?
>
> - How these measurements change as they
> start introducing the practices outlined in this focus area (use
> cases, CRC cards, testing, and so on). If they start a practice and
> don\'t notice any improvement, maybe they don\'t need to do that practice, or they need to do a
> better job incorporating that practice.
>
> This information can provide critical feedback so engineers can
> effectively critique their own work and adjust their pair process. If
> you start engraining some of these quality practices into your
> methodology, you should see fewer defects in your code, and you will
> spend more time in new development phases and less time in rework
> phases.
>
> XP doesn\'t collect these quality metrics. CSP inherits these metrics
> and the measurement-based feedback philosophy from PSP.
>
> Once the programmers have learned that these practices are meant to
> improve their quality, they can start to focus on making their
> schedule more accurate and predictable.

### Focus Area 2: Project Management

> CSP practitioners add to their process techniques that will help them
> manage their time and make and keep commitments. CSP is an interactive
> development process. Iterations should be no longer than three to four
> weeks. You want to have something to show at the end of each
> iteration, something that works, something you can get external
> feedback on. If you spend too much time only on internal workings of
> the project, you\'re sure to get some changes to these internals as
> soon as you start implementing stuff that works with it. You need to
> do something that will be viewed as progress by the most skeptical
> customer. You need to pass some functional test cases, similar to the
> measure of progess in XP.
>
> These short iterations have two purposes. First, it is great to have
> customers take a look at each iteration and to give feedback on
> whether the project is doing what they want it to do. Maybe you\'re
> not doing exactly what the customers thought you\'d do. Maybe they
> tried out what you did and that gave them a great idea or made them
> realize they didn\'t really want what they thought they wanted. Maybe
> their priorities have changed. The main thing to realize is that we
> have trouble understanding perfectly what our customers want and that
> sometimes our customers don\'t know exactly what they want. No amount
> of planning or documenting can change that. We need to be able to
> react to customer changes as well as to our own improved understanding
> of the system. Software development processes that strive to be able
> to react to these inevitable changes are classified as agile or
> adaptive; we consider CSP an agile process.
>
> Second, shorter iterations also help to set boundaries on the accuracy
> and scope of detailed planning. The law of diminishing returns
> definitely applies to detailed project planning. You can probably plan
> what you can accomplish today pretty well. You can probably also plan
> what you could accomplish this week. Beyond that, it gets fuzzy. It\'s
> hard to know what you can do next week without knowing what you did
> this week. Maybe things went faster or more slowly than you had
> planned.
>
> Project management is generally started by making a rough resource
> estimate for the project by first reviewing the problem statement and
> a conceptual design. This estimate is used to determine if the scope
> and the budget are even in the ballpark. At this point, a \"go/no-go\"
> decision needs to be made if the budget, the scope, and the schedule
> simply cannot be reconciled. However, some win-win negotiating tactics
> need to come into play before a \"no-go\" decision is made. Phases
> such as, \"We can\'t finish it by then, but we can get you all but *x*
> by then\" or \"What\'s the minimum functionality you need to launch
> your product?\" should be heard.
>
> So, assuming the project is a go, activities such as use cases and CRC
> cards are done to help understand and document the customer
> requirements and to break the project into one- to three-week
> activities that different developers can own. At this point, you might
> be wondering if, with pair programming, one or two developers own the
> activities. Individual developers \"own\" their own activities. Other
> programmers rotate around the team to help complete these activities.
> Generally, the activities are broken into small (half-day or full-day)
> tasks. It is most beneficial when team members pair with other members
> when a particular task touches parts of the system they are both
> knowledgeable in or they both should be knowledgeable in.
>
> So, the project requirements are understood and the activities are
> assigned. Now we need to have the activity owners estimate how long it
> will take to complete their assignments. For this estimation they have
> two valuable resources to tap: past records and each other. First,
> let\'s look at the records they have. All the way back in the Focus
> Area 0, they should have started recording how much time they spent on
> our tasks. This data is invaluable when we need to develop new
> estimates for how long things will take us. Ideally, we can look
> through all the activities of the current or past projects and see who
> did them and how long the tasks actually took. Then we can think about
> how different or similar our current activities are, based on our
> estimates of our past. When we\'re estimating, it\'s also really
> important to talk to each other. If you look at the list of past
> activities and find one that\'s pretty similar, talk to the people who
> did it. Find out what difficulties they had and what advice they can
> share with you on your estimate.
>
> Now all the manageable pieces of the iteration, the activities, have
> been estimated and have owners. You break these activities down into
> the smallest measurable unit in project management, the task. Tasks
> should be able to be done in a half day or a full day. They are things
> that you can \"check off\" often. You might pair with a different
> person for each task, depending on which parts of the system that
> particular task touches. You break down your activities for the
> iteration into these tasks. Project progress measures the percentage
> of these tasks you accomplish. Using a PSP term, we call this step
> measuring the *earned value*. You earn the value of a task by
> completing it.
>
> Laurie visited an organization that made only one change to their
> prior development process: to break their project planning into weekly
> activities and then into daily tasks. By doing this, the engineers
> assumed much more responsibility and ownership for completing things.
> It\'s really hard to get a firm grasp on what you have to do if
> you\'re assigned some \"big thing\" that you have six months to
> finish. You \"go for the checkmark\" if you have short, measurable
> tasks, especially if, once you complete the tasks, you can pass a test
> case that you couldn\'t pass before.
>
> CSP\'s project management approach is truly a hybrid of both PSP and
> XP. The short iterations and task planning are very similar to XP.
> Basing future estimates on history is advocated by both methodologies,
> although PSP\'s method of extrapolating new estimates from history is
> based on a fairly complicated
>
> proxy-based approach involving linear regression. As we said, CSP used
> PSP\'s earned value tracking in order to determine what percentage of
> a project or increment has been completed.
>

### Summary

> CSP was adapted from PSP. The PSP was developed to guide a singular
> software engineer in how to produce high-quality software predictably
> and to provide mechanisms for measurement-based feedback and analysis.
> This singular engineer could be an island in the middle of a sea of
> hackers or could be on a team of PSP practitioners, because the PSP
> does not create any specific dependencies between programmers and the
> process they use. CSP is similar: Any pair of developers could choose
> to follow the CSP regardless of whether the rest of their team does.
> Part of the reason that PSP and CSP can be so \"pluggable\" is because
> neither process considers team coordination and projectwide
> architecture kinds of things. These are covered in a team structure
> such as that outlined in Watts Humphrey\'s Team Software Process (TSP)
> (2000). With TSP, team members assume roles (such as team leader,
> quality manager, planning manager, development manager) and complete
> specific documents to aid in team communication. Software developers
> following PSP or CSP can work together on a team that uses the TSP.

### Chapter 26. Moving Ahead, Going Beyond

> Today, many colocated professional programmers are practicing pair
> programming. There are, however, some alternatives and variations
> emerging that can increase the scope and influence beyond two
> developers passing the keyboard back and forth. Some of these will be
> discussed in this chapter.
>

### Triplets

> Often, we\'ve heard \"two\'s company, three\'s a crowd\" or \"the
> third wheel\" when we\'ve asked people about triplet programming. But
> then we\'ve also heard some success stories. The success stories had
> two common and simultaneous requisites: three very experienced, very
> mature, very responsible developers, and complex problems that can
> justify three brains. With these components, triplet programming can
> be a route to a solution to a very tough problem.
>
> Jim Coplien tells of an effective triplet at Bell Labs: one person at
> the keyboard, one at the white board, and the last \"thinking out
> loud,\" representing the customer (Coplien 2002). (Maybe the third
> could even be a real customer.) The third person can think without
> losing any brainpower to using his or her hands.
>

### Multidisciplinary Pairs

> The pairs don\'t need to be comprised of two code developers. In the
> scenario in the first chapter, the privacy expert paired with the Web
> form designer, ensuring that the forms did not violate any privacy
> policies. User interface specialists or Web page artists/designers can
> pair with programmers. (After all, some of us who were given the
> ability to program were slighted in the artistic part of the brain.)
> Jim Coplien reports, \"At Mediagenix, a tester sometimes pairs with a
> developer as the tester drives with tests, and the developer fixes
> bugs. This makes it possible to circumvent the project\'s formal bug
> reporting bureaucracy, reducing the time to a stable load\" (2002).
> Last, we\'ve heard many reports of developers pairing with customers,
> which has the added advantage of real-time requirements clarification.
>

### Code Inspections Obsolete?

> Don\'t jump to any conclusions too fast. As we said earlier in the
> book, 80 percent of all programmers don\'t do formal code reviews. For
> these folks, the continual reviews of pair programming are certainly
> beneficial. But what can be said about groups that already do code
> reviews? Does pair programmed code need to be reinspected?
>
> For over 20 years, numerous studies have documented the benefits of
> reviews and inspections for efficient defect removal (Fagan 1976,
> Russell 1991, Weller 1993). These studies need to be reexamined to
> determine the efficiency and effectiveness of inspection after pair
> programming. So, our answer right now is, \"We don\'t know yet.\"
>

### Projection Screens

> In [Chapter 8](#chapter-8.-workplace-layout), we discussed the
> use of at least 17-inch monitors. What if we go way beyond that and
> project the work-in-progress on the wall? A team of researchers at the
> University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, are working on the \"Office
> of the Future\" and the development of just the right technology to
> project programming work-in-progress. \"From now on, one does not have
> to cramp the information into a relatively small monitor, but to have
> as much space as possible and to be limited only by the amount of
> space around\" (Rascar et. al. 1998). Then the navigator will
> certainly have no trouble seeing the work of the driver, will likely
> be more alert, and can actually stand up and point to any areas of
> concern.
>
> Such a setup would also be supportive of triplet programming. Jim
> Coplien witnessed such a programming team in action. \"At Mediagenix
> we found teams that \'programmed with the projector\' where the
> computer screen was projected onto a wall, and a team jointly
> commented and guided the work as one person sat at the keyboard\"
> (2002).
>

### Distributed Pair Programming

> What if pairs cannot be physically next to each other? It has been
> established that distance does matter (Olson and Olson 2000);
> colocated teams perform better. Therefore it is predicted that
> face-to-face pair programmers will outperform distributed pair
> programmers in terms of sheer productivity. However, the inevitability
> of distributed work in contemporary software development calls for
> research in determining how to make this type of work most effective.
>
> There are some initial research findings and experiences with
> distributed pair programming. First, we had a joint development team
> consisting of students from North Carolina State University, led by
> Laurie, and students from University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill
> (UNC), led by Dr. David Stotts. The students used Windows NetMeeting
> to work jointly on one development environment and to speak with each
> other using a microphone/headset. We list the following findings from
> this experiment:

1.  At least one, but perhaps periodic, face-to-face meeting is
    > beneficial. The students used one such meeting to get to know each
    > other and to brainstorm their initial system architecture.

2.  We purchased webcams for the students; they never felt the need to
    > use them. We had surmised that they might periodically use them to
    > talk to each other \"face-to-face\" or might draw a quick sketch
    > of something and then hold it up to the camera. This need never
    > arose.

3.  Using a tool that allows for the distributed teams to switch quickly
    > between a design view, such as a class diagram, and a code view is
    > beneficial. The TogetherSoft Control Center
    > [\[1\]](#bookmark199) has this capability.

        > [http://togethersoft.com](http://togethersoft.com/default.htm)
    
4.  Distributed pair programmers must absolutely be willing to speak
    > while they work. They must explain what they are doing as they are
    > doing it, or the navigator quickly gets lost. This is so essential
    > that programmers who are not willing to speak almost continuously
    > should probably not try to work this way. Because of this, it is
    > likely that the percentage of the population that can do
    > distributed pair programming will be smaller than that that can
    > pair program while colocated with a partner.

> We will continue this research with larger sample sizes of students
> and with practitioners in industry. Results of a Distributed Extreme
> Programming experiment between Siemens developers in Germany and India
> (Kircher et al. 2001) yielded results similar to ours. They did,
> however, recommend the use of video to assess what a partner was
> thinking or his or her reaction to a comment or suggestion. In other
> contexts, we\'ve also heard of pairs preferring pcAnywhere to
> NetMeeting for application sharing.
>
> Laurie and Dr. Stotts plan to work on enhanced collaborative
> environments for distributed pair programmers. We propose to build a
> more effective collaborative environment for pair programming using
> the results of some simple wall-size display experiments at UNC
> (Bishop 2000, Bishop and Welch 2000). We will apply the principles
> uncovered at Bellcore in the VideoWindow project (Fish et al. 1990).
> In this experiment, two rooms (coffee lounges) in different buildings
> at Bellcore were outfitted with video cameras and wall-sized
> projections. In essence, an image of one lounge was sent to the other
> and projected on the back wall, giving the illusion in
>
> each room of a double-size coffee lounge. The researchers discovered
> that many users found the setup to be very natural for human
> communication, due to its size. Two people, one in each room, would
> approach the wall to converse, standing approximately the same
> distance from the wall that they would stand from each other in
> face-to-face conversations.
>
> We believe a more effective collaborative environment can be created
> with a wall-sized display produced by projectors and that a
> corresponding improvement in distributed pair programming will result
> from this enhanced support for collaboration. We will mix video
> imagery (allowing the collaborators to see each other) with digital
> display information (the source code being developed). Communication
> will be via directional microphones placed in the vicinity of the
> workstations, so the participants will not be encumbered with
> headsets. Two distributed collaborators will interact much as they do
> with local pairing; to talk, one will turn to the other (face the
> projection wall) and speak openly in the room. Since the camera is on
> the projection wall, the remote collaborator will have the impression
> that the communicator is looking at him or her. Each will see
> surrounding context and an image of significant size. The illusion to
> be created is a \"joint office\" with the video walls, much like the
> virtual coffee lounge of Bellcore\'s VideoWindow.

### Pair Learning

> Supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, educators at
> North Carolina State University and at the University of California,
> Santa Cruz, are assessing the use of pair programming in beginning
> computer science classes. Through this research, they are examining
> whether working in a pair enhances a student\'s ability to learn with
> another beginning student. They are also examining how these students
> perform in later semesters when they are forced to work alone (many
> teachers still view collaboration as cheating).
>
> For all the good intentions and diligent work of computer science
> educators, students find introductory computer science courses very
> frustrating---so frustrating that typically one quarter of the
> students drop out of the classes and many others perform poorly. A
> recent informal e-mail survey indicated that the percentage of
> students doing poorly in, failing, or withdrawing from introductory
> classes is often as high as 50 percent nationally.
>
> People who have programmed for a while have learned to live through
> extensive debugging sessions. A few too many debugging sessions,
> especially long ones, and beginning students might decide this is not
> the right career path for them. One anticipated outcome of the
> research is to improve the retention of computer science students
> because they are less frustrated and more effective when working with
> a partner.
>
> In particular, this study looks at the retention of the decreasing
> population of female and minority computer science students. We are
> encouraged by research that African-American success rates can be
> dramatically improved in science courses by shifting the learning
> paradigm from individual study to a paradigm that capitalizes on group
> processes, such as student work groups and student-student tutoring
> (Nelson 1996). The pair-learning approach is, of course, such a group
> process.
>
> Initial unpublished results at North Carolina State and published
> results from UC, Santa Cruz (McDowell et al. 2002), indicate that
> students do appear to learn better when working in pairs. At North
> Carolina State, the paired students averaged 5 points higher on exams
> (without their partners, of course) than did the solo programmers. UC,
> Santa Cruz, pair programmers had an average score of 86 percent on
> programming projects while solo programmers averaged 67 percent. The
> pairing students at UC, Santa Cruz, had a retention rate of 92 percent
> while the solo students had a retention rate of 76 percent. We
> currently feel that pair programming is an effective pedagogical tool
> for teaching introductory students.

### Chapter 27. Seven Habits of Effective Pair Programmers

> To end the book, we summarize what we have found to be seven habits of
> effective pair programmers. Many of these techniques have been
> discussed throughout the book, but we consolidate our recommendations
> here.
>
> [Chapter
> 3](#chapter-3.-the-seven-synergistic-behaviors-of-pair-programming)
> talked about \"synergistic behaviors\" of pairs, but these are quite
> different. These seven habits should be deliberately practiced, and
> you should consciously remind yourself of them in order to be most
> effective.
>

### Habit 1: Take Breaks

> \"Pair programming is exhausting but productive\" (Wake 2002). Because
> pair programmers do keep each other continually focused and on-task,
> it can be very intense and mentally exhausting. Periodically taking a
> break is important for maintaining the stamina you need for another
> round of productive pair programming. During the break, it is best to
> disconnect from the task at hand and approach it with a freshness when
> you restart. During breaks, you can do all those things you\'ve been
> putting off---check e-mail, return phone calls, surf the Web (for
> business related purposes, of course).
>
> At a minimum, each hour stand up, stretch, and look at something more
> than three feet away!
>

### Habit 2: Practice Humility

> \"Egoless programming,\" an idea expounded by Gerald Weinberg in *The

> 1998). Learn to laugh at yourself!

### Habit 3: Be Confident/Be Receptive

> It can be very difficult to work with people who have great insecurity
> or anxiety about their programming skills. They tend to have an \"If I
> work with you, you might find out I\'ve never coded with exceptions\"
> defensiveness about them. Programmers with such insecurity should view
> pair programming as a means to improve their skill by constantly
> watching and obtaining feedback from another. It will also make you
> feel more confident when you realize first-hand that no one knows
> everything, and many don\'t know as much as you thought they did.
>
> A fear of appearing stupid also decreases the number of bold proposals
> and ideas suggested. Conversely, programmers who are comfortable
> working with their partners will offer intriguing suggestions and
> interesting strategies with the knowledge that their counterparts feel
> comfortable doing the same. (Dick and Zarnett 2002, Cockburn and
> Williams 2001)
>
> There should be no competition between the partners; both must work
> for a singular purpose, as if the artifact was produced by a single
> good mind. Blame for problems or defects should never be placed on
> either partner. The pair needs to trust each other\'s judgment and
> each other\'s loyalty to the team.
>

### Habit 4: Communicate

> Communication between the pair is essential. Again we recommend that
> not more than a minute pass without some form of communication between
> the pair. One pair programmer says, \"When I pair, 15 seconds without
> talking is a very long time; 30 seconds is an eternity. It\'s not hard
> (and is very important) to learn to type while talking; good pairs
> talk a lot.\" This might seem unachievable for programmers who are
> often thought of as extreme introverts. Alistair Cockburn and Pete
> McBreen share their perspectives:
>
> Programmers are typically stereotyped as noncommunicative individuals
> who like to sit in darkened rooms alone with their computer screens.
> It is not a true stereotype, though.
>
> Programmers just like to communicate about things they like to
> communicate about, usually
>
> the programs they are involved in. Programmers enjoy trading notes
> about XML-RPC or the difficulties in mapping object-ori-ented designs
> to relational databases. They just don\'t like to join in the chitchat
> about things they consider irrelevant. (Cockburn 2002)
>
> Developers are not expected to turn into extroverts. They are expected
> to do what they excel at---namely, to show their colleagues what they
> are working on; to look at what their colleagues are doing to see what
> they can learn; to spot as many loopholes, flaws, and mistakes as
> possible...Not even the most introverted geeks will find this
> requirement hard in a small team of people they know and trust.
> (McBreen 2002)
>
> In the pairing context, Ward Cunningham, one of the founders of XP,
> recommends the driver practice a *reflective articulation* (Chi et al.
> 1989) technique and continually vocalize \"self-explanations.\" As the
> driver, vocalize what you are doing as you are doing it. Be sure to
> speak loudly and clearly enough so that your partner can hear and
> understand you. For example, \"We need to create a temporary variable
> here to accumulate the values as we iterate\" or \"Now we\'ll call the
> SortedByLastName method that will return all the records in the
> database sorted by last name.\"
>
> Reflective articulation has been studied a great deal by sociology and
> education scholars (Narayanan et al. 1995). In the pair programming
> context, this reflective articulation has several benefits. First, we
> can identify flaws in our own logic simply by explaining it to someone
> else. Second, it keeps the navigator engaged because there is constant
> communication with him or her. The navigator can follow what is going
> on much more and can help much more if he or she understands what you
> are trying to do and where you are going.
>

### Habit 5: Listen

> If I were to summarize in one sentence the single most important
> principle I have learned in the field of interpersonal relations, it
> would be this: Seek first to understand, then to be understood. (Covey
> 1989)
>
> *Really* listen to what your partner has to say before responding.
> Don\'t assume you know what he or she is talking about or that he or
> she understands what you are trying to do. Listen to the details of
> what he or she is saying. Don\'t assume he or she is trying to insult
> you or to criticize your ideas. Until proven wrong, assume your
> partner is just trying to get the job done.
>
> Believe that through listening to your partner, your joint knowledge
> can be synergized. Human beings can remember and learn only a bounded
> amount. Therefore humans must consult with others to increase this
> bounded amount. When two are working together, each has his or her own
> set of knowledge and skills. A large subset of this knowledge and
> these skills will be common between the two, allowing them to interact
> effectively. However, the unique skills of each individual will allow
> the pair to engage in interactions that pool their resources to
> accomplish their tasks. \"Collaborative people are those who identify
> a possibility and recognize that their own view, perspective, or
> talent is not enough to make it a reality. Collaborative people see
> others not as creatures who force them to compromise, but colleagues
> who can help them amplify their talents and skills\" (Hargrove 1998).
>

### Habit 6: Be a Team Player

> The most important thing to remember about being a navigator is that
> your partner\'s work is your work. It is joint work that you are 100
> percent responsible for. It is not acceptable to say or think things
> such as, \"You made an error in your design\" or \"That defect was
> from your part.\" Say instead, \"We screwed up the design\" or, better
> yet, \"We just got through our test with no defects!\" Both partners
> own everything.
>
> If you are a navigator, you should feel confident that you can take
> over as driver at any moment. If you don\'t feel this way, ask to be
> the driver so you will be forced to understand what is going on.
>
> Once you believe this, it will be easier to remain active and engaged.
> You wouldn\'t want the driver to screw up your work while you\'re
> daydreaming, would you? You need constantly to be alert and
> questioning. If you don\'t understand what\'s going on, ask! If you
> can think of a better way, suggest it!
>

### Habit 7: Hone the Balance between Compromise and Standing Firm

> Developers who are too egotistical may lack the ability to compromise
> and may become argumentative when paired. The primary purpose of
> pairing is to work toward the best design possible, regardless of from
> where or from whom the design originated. Good development pairs can
> discuss suggestions with-out bias concerning their origin, and they
> can deliberate solely on the merits of the suggestions. (Dick and
> Zarnett 2002) It is very frustrating to work with a partner who flat
> out refuses to accept any suggestions. Before long, the navigator will
> assume his or her input will just be refuted and will give up making
> suggestions.
>
> Conversely, people who always agree with their partners lest they
> create tension also minimize the benefits of collaborative work. For
> favorable idea exchange, there should be some healthy
> disagreement/debate.
>
> Finding the balance between standing firm and compromising is a tricky
> one. If you really believe that you have a better way but your partner
> does not agree, use some of the techniques discussed in [Chapter
> 11](#chapter-11.-tips-n-tricks)---separate and prototype, and so
> on. As you each pursue your idea further, the better idea should be
> more evident. Don\'t be afraid or unwilling to give up to the better
> idea. The goal is for the pair to produce the best possible.
>
> Choose your battles wisely. We learn this lesson raising children. As
> much as you really want that kid to wear blue socks, does it really
> matter if he or she insists on wearing white socks? If your partner
> really wants a
>
> do-while loop but you think it would be better as a for loop, think
> about whether it really makes a difference in this case before being
> insistent or argumentative.
>

### Finale

> Practice these tried-and-true habits, and you should become a more
> effective partner. Old habits can be hard to break. Most of us have
> programmed for (many) years before venturing into pairing. Keep in
> mind that individuals out for themselves may not be maximizing the
> team performance. Let go of old habits for the benefit of your team,
> and have more fun in the process. You\'ve got someone to bounce your
> good ideas off and someone who\'ll be bouncing good ideas off you.
> You\'ve got someone whose work you can help improve and someone
> who\'ll help you when you do something imperfect. If software
> development is sometimes scary, you\'ve got someone to help drive out
> the fear. If software development is a game, then you\'ve got someone
> to play with; that might seem scary, but it\'s a lot more fun!

### Appendix A. Pair Programming Tutorial

> As we\'ve said before, people are often resistant to trying pair
> programming but then are quite enthusiastic once they\'ve actually
> tried it. A good way to get people---programmers and managers
> alike---indoctrinated into the benefits of pair programming is to take
> them through a half-day pair programming exercise. In [Appendix
> A](#appendix-a.-pair-programming-tutorial), we outline such an
> exercise. Note that this exercise requires no programming experience,
> so it should be appropriate to everyone---programmers, managers, QA,
> and so on.
>
> This exercise has been run as a tutorial at several conferences,
> including OOPSLA and NASA\'s Software Engineering Workshop. PowerPoint
> slides with notes for this exercise can be found at:
>
> [http://www4.ncsu.edu/\~lawilli3/PP/tutorial.ppt](http://www4.ncsu.edu/~lawilli3/PP/tutorial.ppt).
>

### Outline of the Exercise

> Here is an overview of a three-hour workshop. In this chapter, we will
> describe the activities of each of the parts.

### Welcome and Exercise Objectives (5 Minutes)

> Welcome the participants. Depending on how well participants know each
> other, you can have them introduce themselves and explain what they
> hope to gain by participating in the exercise. Feel free to insert any
> warm-up exercise of your choice. (Only five minutes of the three hours
> have been allocated to this activity. Warm-up exercises can be great
> ice breakers, but you may need to consider time contraints.)
>
> Next, explain the learning objectives of the exercise:

1.  Participants will experience the difference between working alone
    
    > and working in pairs.
    
2.  Participants will learn about pair programming research results.

3.  Participants will learn tips for transitioning to pair programming.


### Activity I: Pair Understanding (15 Minutes)

> A wonderful benefit of working with a partner is that he or she can
> fill in gaps on knowledge. Where each person in the pair might only
> know or understand 75 percent of what is required, together they can
> strive for 100 percent understanding. To gain this full understanding,
> each person asks questions and uses the other as a sounding board.
> Ultimately, the pair reaches a point where they feel quite confident
> and comfortable moving forward to make progress; they have gained pair
> understanding.
>
> The first activity in the exercise is intended to simulate the gaining
> of pair understanding. The exercise begins with a description of
> something that the participants are not familiar with. The description
> should be fairly logical but not overly clear. After hearing the
> description, participants should intentionally have the feeling, \"I
> think I understand what you are saying, but I\'m not exactly sure.\"
> For example, following is a description of Organizational Patterns
> (Coplien 1995) that can be used for an audience not overly familiar
> with the technique of using such patterns:
>
> We\'ll spend today talking about pair programming. Pair programming is
> not actually such a new concept. There have definitely been people
> doing pair programming for quite a long time. In fact, Jim Coplien
> identified pair programming as an organizational pattern back in the
> middle of the 1990s. He called the pattern \"Developing in Pairs.\"
> How many of you are familiar with organizational patterns (hopefully,
> not the majority of the audience)? Perhaps it\'s appropriate if we
> start by discussing organizational patterns.
>
> First, we need to start by explaining what a pattern is. In computer
> science, many different kinds of patterns have emerged. For example,
> Martin Fowler has a book on analysis patterns (1997) and the Gang of
> Four has a book on design patterns (Gamma et al. 1995). All these
> patterns were inspired by the work of a building architect,
> Christopher Alexander (Alexander et al. 1977). Alexander describes a
> pattern: \"Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over
> again in our environment and then describes the core of the solution
> to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a
> million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.\"
>
> Considering Alexander\'s description of patterns, organizational
> patterns are patterns applied to organizations, problems that occur in
> organizations and a general solution to that problem. For example,
> let\'s discuss the \"Developing in Pairs\" organizational pattern. A
> pattern describes a problem, which in this case is \"People are scared
> to solve problems alone.\" And the pattern describes the core of the
> solution to that problem, which is pair programming.
>
> Just to make sure that we all understand what patterns are, let\'s see
> if you can name some patterns that exist in your own organizations....
> Remember, the pattern has a problem and a general solution. Think for
> a minute, and then share some of the patterns you have in your own
> organization.
>
> At this point, the exercise facilitator gives the participants a
> minute or so to think of organizational patterns and then asks for
> people voluntarily to share their organizational patterns with the
> group. The desired result is that the group will provide very little
> input. If it appears there is an organizational pattern expert in the
> group, let him or her share no more than two patterns before saying,
> \"I\'d like to hear from someone else.\" It is likely that people will
> not share because the description of organizational patterns was not
> overly clear. It could have been made clearer with the addition of
> some examples.
>
> Next the facilitator can say, \"In order to make organizational
> patterns more clear, let\'s work in pairs. Between the two of you, try
> to come up with two or three patterns you have in your organization.
> Remember once gain that a pattern has a problem and a general solution
> as the \'Developing in Pairs\' pattern showed us.\" Then give the
> pairs no more than five minutes to come up with some patterns. Ask
> again for pairs to share their organizational patterns voluntarily.
> The desired result is that pairs are now overflowing with
> organizational patterns.
>
> Individually, each person might not have fully understood
> organizational patterns. Once each individual had someone to work
> with, the pair did two things. First, they clarified each other\'s
> understanding of organizational patterns. They asked each other
> questions until they both had a good comprehension of what the
> organizational patterns are. Second, each person was a sounding board
> for the other. One could say, \"I think \'stand-up meetings\' are a
> pattern. The problem is lack of daily communication; the solution is a
> stand-up meeting. Do you think that is a pattern?\" If the partner
> says \"Yes, that\'s definitely a pattern. That\'s a great pattern.\"
> Once receiving that validation, the participant will then confidently
> share this with the entire group.
>
> The facilitator should point out the lesson of the exercise: Pairs
> help each other gain full understanding and help each other gain
> confidence for moving forward.
>

### Research Results in Pair Programming (40 minutes)

> The first section of the PowerPoint slides are reviewed. Notes
> explaining each slide are included with the presentation. The 40
> minutes allow time for questions and group discussion. The slides
> include
>
> - A Definition of Pair Programming
> - A Historical Perspective of Pair Programming
> - Research Results
> - Synergistic Behaviors of Pair Programmers
>

### Activity II: Individual Design (15 minutes)

> For the next activity, the group is shown a problem statement for a
> transportation device. The device needs to be able to
>
> - Transport people faster than they can move by walking, but it must go less than 10 mph.
> - Stop on demand.
> - Carry at least one person.
> - Restrain passengers so they don't fall out.
> - Look nice.
>
> Participants are asked to spend approximately five minutes designing
> their device. At the end of this time, the participants are placed
> into groups of four. They share their design with their group.
> Specifically, each group should discuss the aspects that are common
> and unique among each design. Approximately five minutes should be
> allotted for this sharing.
>
> Then all exercise participants discuss the exercise for five minutes.
> The discussion should focus on the similarities and differences among
> the individual designs.
>
> The facilitator should point out the lesson of the exercise*:* When
> engineers work individually on a design, there will be some
> similarities among the designs. However, each engineer will typically
> incorporate a larger number of unique features.
>

### Break (20 minutes)


### Adoption of Pair Programming Presentation (20 minutes)

> The PowerPoint slides from the second section are reviewed. Notes
> explaining each slide are included with the presentation. The allotted
> 20 minutes allows time for questions and group discussion. The slides
> include
>
> - Managerial Resistance
> - How to Gain Acceptance from Peers
> - Transitioning by Choice
>

### Activity III: Individuals Working on a Team (15 minutes)

> Participants stay with the group of four they worked with in Activity
> II. For the next activity, the group is shown another, slighly
> different, problem statement for a transportation device. The device
> needs to be able to
>
> - Transport people faster than 10 mph
> but slower than 100 mph.
> - Stop on demand.
> - Carry at least one person.
> - Restrain passengers so they don\'t fall out.
> - Look nice.
>
> Each participant is given the assignment of completing one aspect of
> the transportation device design. The four roles are: Appearance,
> Propelling System, Braking System, Restraint System. Each participant
> must complete his or her assignment without collaborating with the
> team. Approximately two minutes are given for this activity. At this
> time, each participant is asked to draw the entire transportation
> device, again without collaborating with team members (approximately
> two minutes). Last, the team members must integrate their design into
> one transportation device. The integrated device must take the
> appearance from the one participant in charge of appearance, the
> braking system from the participant who designed that, and so on. This
> should take approximately five minutes. The remaining six minutes are
> spent on a discussion of how far each person\'s individual view of the
> system was from the integrated device. It is fun to make this point by
> having selected participant teams draw their own view and their
> integrated view on transparency slides. Then these teams can show the
> entire workshop each individual view versus their integrated device.
> Additionally, it is likely that the integrated device will not have
> components that do not logically fit together.
>
> The facilitator should point out the lessons of the exercise: When
> engineers work individually on a design, the components may not fit
> together when integrated. Additionally, individuals do not have a good
> feel for the overall design of the project.
>

### Pair Programming Implementation Items Presentation (20 minutes)

> The Power Point slides are from the third section of reviewed. Notes
> explaining each slide are included with the presentation. The 20
> minutes allow time for questions and group discussion. The slides
> include
>
> - Good/Bad Pairs
> - Pair Rotation
> - Workspace Layout
> - Other Items
>

### Activity IV: Pairs Rotating Around a Team (20 minutes)

> Participants stay with the group of four they worked with in Activity
> III. For the next activity, the group is shown another, slighly
> different, problem statement for a transportation device. The device
> needs to be able to
> 
> - Transport people faster than 100 mph.
> - Stop on demand.
> - Carry at least one person.
> - Restrain passengers, so they don\'t fall out.
> - Look nice.
>
> Each participant is assigned a specific role in the design of the
> device. The four roles are Appearance, Propelling System, Braking
> System, Restraint System. Each participant is given ultimate authority
> of that aspect of the device in the upcoming collaborative effort.
> Each participant must complete his or her assignment without
> collaborating with the team. A rotation of pairs then takes place.

1.  Each participant is assigned a partner to work with. Together the pair works on the two things they were assigned for two minutes.
    
2.  Partners rotate so that each person is paired with a team member he
 or she did not yet work with. Together the pair work on the two
 things they were assigned for two minutes.

3.  Partners rotate again so that each person is paired with the last
team member he or she did not work with. Together the pair works
on the two things they were assigned for two minutes.

> At this time, each participant is asked to draw the entire
> transportation device---again without collaborating with team members
> (approximately two minutes). Last, the team members must integrate
> their design into one transportation device. The integrated device
> must take the appearance from the one participant in charge of
> appearance, the braking system from the participant who designed that,
> and so on. This should take approximately three minutes. The remaining
> four minutes are spent on a discussion of how far people\'s individual
> view of the system was from the integrated device. Again, it is fun to
> make this point by having selected participant teams draw their own
> view and their integrated view on transparency slides. Then these
> teams can show the entire workshop each individual view versus their
> integrated device. Hopefully, the individuals have a better view of
> the overall device than they did in the previous exercise.
>
> The facilitator should point out the lessons of the exercise*:* Pairs
> that rotate around a group have a better understanding of the entire
> project. Additionally, the components that are designed by pairs that
> rotate around the group are more likely to fit together into a
> cohesive system.

### Summary and Conclusion (5 minutes)

> At the end of the session, the facilitator should point out again the
> lessons learned from the exercise. A learning objective of the session
> was for people to experience pair programming first-hand. This was
> done through the activities. Added objectives of the activities were
> to show that pair programming can be used to spread system knowledge
> better around a group and to aid in individual components formulating
> one cohesive system when integrated. Additionally, participants
> learned about research results of pair programming, and they acquired
> hints and tips about transitioning to pair programming.
>
> After reviewing the objectives of the exercise, the facilitator should
> ask for participant feedback and should allow an open discussion on
> implementing pair programming in the organization. This kind of
> discussion would certainly take more than five minutes, but it should
> be very valuable.

### Appendix B. An Economic Analysis of Pair Programming

> *by Hakan Erdogmus and Laurie Williams*
>
> In this appendix, we present a detailed economic analysis of pair
> programming based on the empirical study conducted at the University
> of Utah, as discussed in [Chapter 4](#chapter-4.-overcoming-management-resistance-to-pair-programming).
> (You should probably read[Chapter 4](#chapter-4.-overcoming-management-resistance-to-pair-programming)
> before reading this appendix because we won\'t go back over the
> details of the experiment.) In [Chapter 4](#chapter-4.-overcoming-management-resistance-to-pair-programming),
> we indicated that pairs produce higher-quality code but that it might
> take 15 percent longer to produce this higher-quality code. Once code
> is written, it then goes on to testing and ultimately to the customer.
> When you consider the savings of putting higher-quality code into test
> and into the hands of the customer, our economic analysis shows that
> this initial 15 percent cost is more than made up for. We write this
> appendix for the reader who would like to know more about how we can

### Introduction

> The economic feasibility of pair programming is a key issue. Many
> people instinctively reject pair programming because they think that
> code development costs will double. If it is more expensive, managers
> simply will not permit it. Naturally, the goal of a software firm is
> to be as profitable as possible while providing customers with the
> best, high-quality products quickly and cheaply. Organizations decide
> whether to adopt process improvements based on the business value of
> their outcome.
>
> First we compute and analyze a basic comparison of the processes. This
> basic comparison indicates that pairs perform better with regard to
> efficiency and overall productivity. We further this basic comparison
> by incorporating additional factors into a more complex Net Present
> Value (NPV) analysis. This economic comparison indicates that pair
> programming should be considered as an economical alternative over
> solo programming. NPV considers the time value of money: the premise
> that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future.
> Economic models based on NPV have previously been suggested to
> evaluate the return on software quality and infrastructure initiative
> (Boehm 1981; Erdogmus 1999; Erdogmus and Vendergraaf 1999; Favaro et
> al. 1998; Levy 1987).
>

### Factors of the Basic Comparison Model

> Sound research design guides us to have only one experimental

### The Basic Comparison Model

> In the basic comparison model, we compare two metrics, e
> (*efficiency)* andp0 (*overall productivity).*

### Efficiency

> *Efficiency* is defined as the percentage effort spent on developing
> new code relative to the total life-cycle effort (which includes the
> effort expended on rework).
>
> Given a productivity rate of p, the effort required in person-hours to
> deployw lines of code of output is given by

![](myMediaFolder/5b3837873fa0ca0c8c2e29838bf44a458d488b21.png)

> This quantity specifies the *initial development* (or *predeployment*)
> *effort* and is followed by*rework* (or
>
> *postdeployment*) *effort* once the code has been delivered to the
> client.
>
> Rework effort, *Epost*, is the maintenance effort expended due to
> runaway defects after a piece of new code has been deployed.

![](myMediaFolder/2bb0a7efd9ac6f9886c9be492e6966b7097628ec.png)

> Here wb is the number of defects, andr is the speed of rework. Effort
> is always adjusted to the work unit by multiplying it by the work unit
> size *N*.
>
> Total effort, *Etot*, is the sum of the initial development and rework
> efforts:

![](myMediaFolder/20f0a7e01f9f80fe035bea879d382025ea4f3555.png)

> Efficiency, e, is then the ratio of the initial development effor*E*t
> *pre* to the total effort*Etot*. It is given by:

![](myMediaFolder/bae75cfc447b770976d49de71c566fc205e59936.png)

![](myMediaFolder/0e2874e32948be8d0375217c56f9dc888ec3501e.png)

### Overall Productivity

> *Overall productivity*, p 0, is the average hourly output of
> defect-free code per programmer hour (assuming that the code is defect
> free after rework). It equals the total output w in LOC divided by the
> total effor*E*t *tot* in
>
> person-hours. This measure shows just how much the \"realized
> productivity\" can be dominated by the extensive cost of rework late
> in the life cycle. Expressed in terms of efficiency and new-code
> productivity, overall productivity is given by

### Factors of the Economic Comparison Model

> The second comparison model is more complex than the basic comparison
> model and considers additional important factors that determine
> economic feasibility.
>
> A software project incurs costs as it accumulates labor hours and
> realizes value as it delivers functionality. A project is economically
> feasible when the total value it creates exceeds the total cost it
> incurs. We assume that the net value generated depends on (1) the
> project\'s labor cost, (2) the time value of money/present value, and
>
> \(3\) the value that the project earns proportionate with the output
> it produces. The following sections discuss the factors and the
> underlying parameters that will be used in the advanced analysis.

### Labor Cost

> Programmer labor (*C*) is often the most important cost driver in a
> software development project. We will assume that initial development
> and rework are performed by the same work unit, resulting in the same
> constant value for both variables. Because *C* is assumed to be
> invariant, we will later be able to eliminate it using a ratio metric.

### Time Value of Money and Present Value

> When costs and benefits of a project are spread over time, the time at
> which the costs are incurred and the benefits are realized must be
> taken into account. A cash flow expected to occur in the future is
> worth less in today\'s dollars than a cash flow that occurs now. As
> the time horizon widens, the difference between the value of a dollar
> today and the value of a dollar in the future also widens. Time value
> of money captures the spread between these two values. *Discounting*
> is the process of downward adjusting a future cash flow to express it
> in today\'s value using a compound interest rate, called the *discount
> rate*. The discounted value of the cash flow is referred to as the
> *present value* (PV).
>
> In economic terms, cost and benefits of a project are represented as
> negative and positive cash flows, respectively, that occur at specific
> points in time. The fundamental implication of time value of money is
> that a project should earn as fast as possible and spend as slow as
> possible to generate maximum economic benefit.

### Earned Value

> Earned value (*EV*) expresses the output produced by a work unit using
> a linear relationship between development effort and value. Each unit
> of new code produced earns a fixed amount of value. We assume that
>
> rework effort does earn value. Only projects that are 100 percent
> efficient earn extra value for each labor hour, creating a
> disincentive to produce defective code and, conversely, an incentive
> to produce quality code.
>
> Let *unit value*, *V*, refer to the average value earned by one unit
> of output produced. In our cas*V*e,is the average value of a single
> line of new code. Then, earned value corresponding to an output of w
> lines of code is given by

![](myMediaFolder/36a99eba8eda12c5a92bc1de40f5e56d30c44616.png)

### Value Realization

> *Realized value* is value that is realized by the client when a
> functional, defect-free product has been delivered to a customer.
> Earned value is not the same as realized value. For example, earned
> value may never be realized if a project fails to deliver a functional
> product to the client.

### The Software Factory Model

> For our economic analysis, we consider a value realization model
> called the *Software Factory*. New code is developed, deployed, and
> reworked in very small increments. Initial development of new code and
> rework of deployed code are intertwined in a never-ending cycle. Value
> is realized in very small increments as microchunks of new
> functionality are gradually delivered. Consequently, earned and
> realized value are essentially the same. The Software Factory model is
> illustrated in [Figure B-1](#figure-b-1.-the-software-factory-model-of-value-realization).
> The ticks represent microdeployment points where small chunks of new
> code are delivered incrementally. In the perfect (idealized) version
> of the Software Factory model, the distance between two deployment
> points approaches zero, resulting in a truly continuous process.
> Emerging agile software development methodologies (Fowler 2000) such
> as XP (Beck et al. 2001) and SCRUM (Rising 2000) support frequent
> delivery of working code to customers. Agile methodologies are best
> treated under the Software Factory.

### Defect Recovery Efficiency

> Defect recovery efficiency involves two components: *latency* and
> *coverage*. Latency is the elapsed time between the deployment of a
> software artifact and the discovery of a fault by the client. Coverage
> is the number of defects reported or discovered in relation to the
> total number of defects (including those that have not been
> discovered). In practice, the discovery of defects by the client can
> be neither instantaneous nor complete. For example, Jones (1997)
> states that in large industrial projects, more than half of the
> defects in customer code have a latency of one year, while total
> coverage four years after deployment hovers around 97 percent.
>
> In emerging, agile processes, continual testing and frequent client
> feedback are believed to lead to a defect recovery with low latency
> and high cov-erage. In our analysis, we assume a perfectly efficient
> defect recovery process---one with full coverage and zero latency.
> These idealized conditions are opposing in terms of their impact on
> net value generated. While increased coverage tends to decrease net
> value, increased latency tends
>
> to increase it. When time value of money is taken into account, these
> assumptions lead to a conservative overall bias with a mild tendency
> to underestimate net value. However, the level of underestimation may
> be different for different development processes.

### The Economic Comparison Model

> **Net Present Value (*NPV*)**
>
> Capital investment decisions are often made based on the concept of
> Net Present Value (Ross 1996). Economic models based on *NPV* have
> previously been used to evaluate the return on software quality and
> infrastructure initiatives (Levy 1987; Boehm 1981; Erdogmus and
> Vandergraaf 1999; Favaro et al. 1998).
>
> *NPV* is the difference between the present value of benefits and the
> present value of costs:

![](myMediaFolder/f5d184e27482a57476af03cca8334ddef2156cec.jpg)

> where PV denotes present value.
>
> A project is thought to have business value when its *Net Present
> Value*,
>
> *NPV*, is positive and to be unprofitable when its*NPV* is negative.
> Among a set of possible projects, the one with the highest *NPV*
> generates the most value and should be favored over the others.
>
> For the Software Factory model, *NPV* reduces to

![](myMediaFolder/a62bfad9829078aac225fca5200f57354ec0db10.png)

> Here *IRV* denotes *Incremental Realized Value* and *TDC* denotes
> *Total Discounted Cost*. Following is a discussion of each of these.
>
> *NPV* is very sensitive to changes in*V,* the average value earned by
> one unit of output produced, measured in
>
> \$/LOC. [Figure B-2](#figure-b-2.-npv-for-a-pair-under-the-software-factory-model-as-a-function-of-unit-value-v-and-cut-off-timt-e-for-a-fixed-annual-discount-rate-of-d-0.1.-output-is-plotted-in-klocs.-cut-off-time-measured-in-years)

> Because of this sensitivity, our interest is not on *NPV* per se. We
> need a derived metric whose value can be used to rank two alternatives
> independent of a particular choice of unit value and of the constant
> labor cost*C. Breakeven Unit Value* meets the first need.
>
> **Breakeven Unit Value**
>
> *Breakeven Unit Value* (*BUV*) is the threshold value of*V* above
> which the*NPV* is positive. *BUV* is determined by solving the
> equation *NPV* = 0 for*V*. Recall that*V* is measured in \$/LOC, based
> on the assumption that each unit of output produced increases the
> value earned by a constant amount.
>
> A small *BUV* is better than a large*BUV*. As *BUV* increases, a
> project becomes less and less worthwhile because higher and higher
> margins are required to turn a profit. In the Software Factory model,
> *BUV* also makes the economic comparison independent of the particular
> choice of the discount rate.

### *BUV* in the Software Factory

> When both value realization and cost accumulation are continual and
> incremental, *BUV*\'s dependence on both output and discount rate is
> broken. However, *BUV* remains dependent on*C*, the hourly labor late.
>
> For example, for a fixed labor cost of *C* = \$50/person-hour, a
> soloist achieves a*BUV* of \$12/LOC while a pair achieves a *BUV* of
> \$7/LOC, indicating an advantage for the pair. These are the minimum
> marginal benefits required in the Software Factory for a project to
> break even.

### Breakeven Unit Value Ratio (*BUVR*)

> A comparison can be made between the return on investment offered by
> two different processes through an examination of the ratio of their
> *BUV*s.
>
> Define *BUV* Ratio (*BUVR*) as the ratio of the*BUV* of a soloist to
> the*BUV* a pair.

![](myMediaFolder/08a1ccc19beb84e235bcc4a7f0b86a1494e1b3e2.png)

> Values of *BUVR* greater than unity indicate an advantage for pairs;
> values smaller than unity indicate an advantage for soloists. As this
> ratio increases, the advantage of the pair over the soloist also
> increases. The metric *BUVR* makes the comparison between the two work
> units independent not only o*V*f, but also of the hourly labor cost
> *C*.

### *BUV* Ratio in the Software Factory

> The *BUV* Ratio, *BUVR,* under the Software Factory model is given by

![](myMediaFolder/25f6904a249097d5576ef1c2934bf275aac8fe99.png)

> Taking the ratio effectively eliminates the invariant *C* that appears
> in the*BUV* equation. The value of*BUVR* is thus constant at 1.7,
> representing roughly a 40 percent advantage for the pairs over the
> soloist. Note that this advantage is independent of time value of
> money (discount rate), output produced, cut-off time (time horizon of
> the project), and labor cost. Effectively we obtain a metric that
> provides an all-around comparison.
>
>

### Derivation of *BUV* Ratio

> For those mathematically inclined readers, we now derive the *BUV*
> ratio. Otherwise, skip right to the summary at the end.

### Marginal Value Earned

> We need to consider *Marginal Value Earned* (*MVE*) in order to
> calculate*Incrementally Realized Value* (*IRV*), the first component
> in the *NPV* formula for the Software Factory.*MVE* is the average
> value earned per additional unit of elapsed time (measured in \$/year;
> elapsed time refers to compressed time). Given a completion or
>
> cut-off time of t, *MVE* equals

![](myMediaFolder/dbbfe1329c3183ff884c012594950fb969f7a468.png)

> Representing output w in terms of elapsed time eliminates the
> variablet, allowing *MVE* to be expressed in terms of productivity p
> and efficiencye. Let the constant*hy* denote the total number of labor
> hours in a calendar year. Then *MVE* can be rewritten as

![](myMediaFolder/8af3a14a72d3d6abfd13f95d827d6456386c5300.png)

### Incrementally Realized Value

### Marginal Cost

> *Marginal Cost*
> (*mC*![](myMediaFolder/0eb043e7100674a9cf19392c534b2136193ec69e.png)) is the expected incremental cost of initial

### Total Discounted Cost

### Appendix C. Pair Programming in the Classroom

> The technique of pair programming has also been used in the
> undergraduate computer science classroom. In [Appendix
> C](#appendix-c.-pair-programming-in-the-classroom), we\'ll
> explain the benefits we see to students and to educators. We\'ll also
> give some guidance to educators who would like to try pair programming
> in their classroom. We\'d like to say, \"Just have your students work
> in pairs---what\'s the big deal?\" However, we realize that there are
> some problems and issues we want you to be prepared for. All in all,
> we can strongly encourage you to surmount the initial obstacles and
> adjust your classes to allow your students to work in pairs. It\'s
> good for you and good for them.
>

### Benefits to Educators

> Pair programming makes the instructor feel more positive about the
> class. Their students are happier, and the assignments are handed in
> on time and are of higher quality. The classes are calmer; the
> students are more satisfied and self-sufficient.
>
> Another very positive effect for the teaching staff; there are fewer
> questions! The students no longer look to the teaching staff as their
> sole source of technical advice. The first time Laurie taught with
> pair programming, it was a Web programming class in 1999, when people
> didn\'t even know HTML. The students were very familiar with
> programming, but they were not familiar with the Active Server Pages
> (ASP) Web programming languages learned and used in the class. The
> majority of the students had used only WYSIWYG Web page editors prior
> to taking the class. During the eleven-week semester, the stu-dents
> learned advanced HTML, JavaScript, VBScript, Active Server Page
> Scripting, Microsoft Access/SQL, and some ActiveX commands. In many
> cases, the students would need to intertwine statements from all these
> languages into one program listing---some of the content running on
> the browser and some running on the NT server, adding to the overall
> complexity of the program. Upon course completion, the students were
> all writing Web scripts that had significant dynamic content that
> accessed and updated a Microsoft Access database---applications
> similar (although smaller) to what you would find on a typical
> ecommerce Web site. The remarkable thing was that students barely
> needed Laurie\'s help. During lab sessions, drivers were typing, and
> navigators were often flipping pages of books and class notes, guiding
> the drivers through the new techniques they had just learned and
> needed to apply. When one partner did not know or understand
> something, the other almost always did. Between the two of them, they
> could tackle anything.
>
> The number of cheating cases is reduced because collaboration is
> legitimized. We believe that pair programming also cuts down on
> cheating because pair pressure causes the students to start working on
> projects earlier and to budget their time more wisely. Additionally,
> students have a peer to turn to for help and therefore do not feel as
> helpless.
>
> Although it is probably obvious, we must mention that grading can be
> significantly reduced when two students submit one assignment. This
> does not mitigate the need to provide individual performance
> evaluation; however, it does reduce the load for those assignments
> done in pairs.

### Benefits to Students

> Pair programming reduces the frustration for many computer science
> students. As we all know, a small typo or a missing semicolon can cost
> hours of debugging time. Those of us who have programmed for years
> deal with this frustration. But students who are still choosing their
> career path must just give up on programming as a profession after a
> few bouts of six-hour debugging sessions. For all the good intentions
> and diligent work of computer science educators, students find
> introductory computer science courses very frustrating---so
> frustrating that typically one quarter of the students drop out of the
> classes and many others perform poorly.
>
> Having a continual reviewing of the navigator will reduce the need for
> these long, laborious debugging sessions. Rather than waiting minutes,
> hours, or even a day to get help from a teacher, pairs might be able
> to provide the answer immediately. Far less frustrating! We believe
> that data that is now being collected will ultimately show that pair
> programming reduces the drop-out rate of computer science graduates.
>
> Students are much like the novice-novice pairs in [Chapter
> 15](#chapter-15.-novice-novice-pairing). Students
> especially---female and minority students---often do a lot of negative
> self-talk. If they struggle with a program or a new programming
> construct, they often tell themselves that they must be the only ones
> who don\'t understand. They don\'t ask enough questions. If they were
> only smarter, they wouldn\'t need to ask questions. But, on the other
> hand, if they are working with a partner, one of two things can
> happen. First, their partner might explain something to them in a
> nonthreatening way (or they\'ll watch their partner do something and
> then understand it). Or, if they don\'t understand something and their
> partner doesn\'t understand something...well, then, it must be hard.
> (Negative self-talk is reduced.) They then have the conviction to ask
> for help---where solo students might suffer in silence, hour after
> hour.
>
> As with industrial pairing, pairing in the classroom helps students
> get to know each other on a more personal basis. At most universities,
> class sizes are getting bigger. Students might feel like a just face
> in the crowd.
>
> However, if they are \"forced\" to work with a peer, they\'ll get to
> know that peer. Rotate the pairs, and they\'ll get to know many other
> peers. We\'re also hoping that research results will ultimately show
> that more women will be attracted to computer science if programming
> becomes more social and collaborative. Some researchers have distinct
> preferences for different kinds of environments (collaborative versus
> competitive, social versus individualistic) (Gilligan, 1982; Ruddick,
> 1989).
>
> All in all, we\'ve seen that students are happier and less frustrated.
> They have the camaraderie of another peer while they completed their
> assignments. Between the two in the pair, they could figure almost
> everything out. Students were more confident in their work. They felt
> good that they had a peer helping them to remove and prevent defects.
> They also felt good that they were better able to come up with more
> creative, efficient solutions when working with a partner.

### Issues to Consider

> Here are some hints and tips you and your students if you venture into
> the world of pair learning, that is, teaching your students
> programming through pair programming.
>
> - Run as much of the Pair Programming
> Tutorial ([Appendix A](#appendix-a.-pair-programming-tutorial))
> as you can with your class. One would think that if you told students
> to work with a partner, they\'d be very happy they didn\'t have to
> work sold on the idea. Experiencing the benefits through the tutorial helps
> them with being sold.
>
> - If at all possible, provide the
> students some class/lab time to work with their partner. During this
> time, the pair \"bonds\" by actually accomplishing something together
> and will generally plan their next meeting. During the required
> class/lab time, the teaching staff can ensure that the two are working
> together at one computer and that the roles of driver and observer are
> rotated.
>   
>   In our first semester of running paired labs, we were surprised to
> find the TAs were not very forceful with the students about pairing.
> If a student didn\'t want to pair, the TAs didn\'t make them pair.
> They never told the students it was time to rotate (driver and
> navigator). You will certainly need to coach your TAs, in fact, plan
> on it. Have them read this chapter! Also, we decided to purchase some
> funny looking kitchen timers and give one to each TA. It is standard
> operating procedure in the lab that \"When the tomato timer dings,
> switch!\"
>
> - \"Management by Walking Around,\"
> MBWA, that\'s what it\'s called in industry, anyway. Once students
> start working in pairs in the lab, the TA gets asked very few
> questions. TAs are generally students who have their own homework. The
> natural tendency is for them to sit at the TA computer and do their
> own homework if they are not asked questions by their class. If they
> ignore their class, the pairs could be behaving dysfunctionally---not
> respecting the tomato timer, one student doing all the work, one
> student slipping off to another computer to check his or her e-mail,
> and so on. We now explain to our TAs that they must walk around the
> lab and visit each pair several times during the lab period. The TA
> must fill out a little form with short observations of the working
> pair and hand this form in each week.
>
> - To ensure the TAs are actually doing
> what they need to do, we suggest professors periodically drop by to
> see how things are going. There\'s more room for error with paired
> labs. Labs without pairs are event driven; the events are student
> questions. These events happen a lot and the TAs will generally fill
> their entire lab period by walking around and answering student
> questions. The TAs for paired labs must display more leadership and
> initiative: They must insist students work in pairs, rotate, and even
> out the work. They must be proactive about MBWA. Stopping in
> periodically will allow professors to make sure the right things are
> happening.
>
> - We encourage you to change the makeup
> of the pairs periodically throughout the semester. There are several
> reasons to do this. First, it ensures no one is \"stuck\" with a bad
> partner for the entire semester. Doubtlessly, some students are more
> skilled than others. A more skilled student can tolerate a less
> skilled student if he or she doesn\'t feel responsible for the partner
> the whole semester. Pairs can also be more tolerant of their
> partner\'s poor hygiene or sloppy work habits if they are not
> \"married\" for the semester. Switching the pairs also aids in peer
> evaluation, which we\'ll talk about next. When two people work
> together, comments on contribution can end up being one person\'s word
> against another\'s. \"He did nothing.\" \"I did too! You did
> nothing.\" However, when you rotate partners throughout the semester,
> if every person a student pairs with says his or her partner didn\'t
> do anything, it\'s likely the partner really did do nothing. By the
> way, we also assign the pairs (using a Web-based program). We don\'t
> allow them to choose their own partners for the labs. We have a
> three-hour closed lab in which they complete their assignment. So we
> do not have to worry about the pairs having compatible schedules
> outside of class.
>
> - Students need to have the motivation
> to contribute and not to ride on the coattails of their partner.
> Students need to be given a formal mechanism for reporting on the
> contributions of their partners and to provide a self-assessment of
> their own contribution. Whenever the students are about to switch to a
> performance) to 20 (superior performance) on each of the following
> questions:
>
> - Did the student read the lab and
> preparatory material before coming to the scheduled lab?
>
> - Did the student do his or her fair
> share of the work?
>
> - Did the student cooperatively follow
> the pair programming model (rotating roles of driver and navigator)?
>
> - Did the student make contributions to
> the completion of the assignment?
>
> - Did the student cooperate?
>
> Based on their score on each of these five questions, students receive
> a peer evaluation score of 0 to 100 percent. We multiply the score
> they receive on their program by their peer evaluation score to get
> their lab score. For example, if they get 100 percent on their program
> and their peer evaluation score is a 50 percent (must not have been an
> effective partner), they get a 50 percent on their lab.
>
> - The last few examples refer to classes
> that do have some form of lab. It is more challenging to integrate
> pair programming into a class in which there is no lab. Requiring
> students to work together without \"forcing\" them to start working
> together---because you have no lab setting for the forcing--- can
> easily lead to failure. Students are very busy, and many do not want
> to take the extra effort to meet their partner in the lab. It\'s just
> easier to do the assignment in their dorm room, on their own computer,
> with the stereo blasting in their headphones. If you have no lab
> period, it would probably be best to make pair programming an optional
> arrangement for completing assignments, whereby students can choose
> between working alone or with a partner. We\'ve also seen the
> suspicious results where students get 100 percent on projects where
> they paired and 30 percent on their exams.
>
> Hmmm, ...something\'s fishy around here. Now our students have to earn
> the right to pair. In order to pair on an assignment, they must get
> above-average exam scores and higher than 90 percent on their peer
> evaluations.
>
> We hope we didn\'t scare you with some of the issues we found or the
> suggestions we\'ve made. We really do believe that pair learning is
> beneficial for the students and the instructor. There are some
> adjustments that need to be made. But, soon these adjustments will be
> normal procedures. It\'s worth it!

### Appendix D. An Introduction to Test Driven Development

> As stated in [Chapter
> 23](#chapter-23.-my-partner-is-so-smart-and-other-too-little-ego-problems),
> many people have said they have really come to see the benefits of
> pair programming when they coupled pair programming and test driven
> development (TDD). Both pair programming and TDD have been practiced
> in isolation by programmers for many, many years. But the emergence of
> Extreme Programming has popularized both techniques. In [Appendix
> D](#appendix-d.-an-introduction-to-test-driven-development), we
> will briefly describe the TDD approach so that you can consider
> marrying the two together in your own development.
>

### Examples

> In order to demonstrate several points about TDD, two scenarios will
> be discussed.

### Scenario One

> Consider we want to write a function that adds two numbers. With TDD,
> the first thing we do is to write the first test case for this
> functionality. For example,

#### int sum = Calculator.sum(2,2); assertEquals(4, sum);

> In order to write this test case, some logical or interface design
> decisions were made: (1) There would be a calculator class; (2) the
> calculator class would have a sum method; and (3) the sum method would
> return an integer value.

### Scenario Two

> This simple example was based on one described by Kent Beck in IEEE
> Software (2001).
>
> Suppose we want to write a function that, given a person of a certain
> age, returns the person\'s mortality table. We begin by writing

#### MortalityTable actualTable = new MortalityTable(bob); AssertEquals(expectedTable, actualTable);

> Now we need to create a Person \"bob\" to pass as a parameter to the
> MortalityTable constructor. To create a person, there is a Person
> constructor that takes 11 parameters. We start to add a line at the
> beginning of our test case to create \"bob\" so we can use the object
> to create an actualTable. We begin to write:

#### Person bob = new Person(\"Bob\", \"Newhart\", 48, NON-SMOKER,

> Then we realize that this constructor takes a lot of arguments---maybe
> there\'s a simpler way. Actually, to get a mortality table, all we
> really need to know is the age of the person and if he or she is a
> smoker. We do not have to create a Person at all. So we change our
> test case to

#### MortalityTable actualTable = new MortalityTable(48, NON-SMOKER);

> After writing test cases that generally will not even compile, we
> create our physical design and implementation
>
> in order to pass these test cases. We incrementally think of every
> test case we can---to handle new functionality, to handle error
> conditions, and so on. We write a few test cases, implement the code,
> write a few test cases, implement the code, and so on. We keep our
> work within our intellectual control because we are continuually
> making small design and implementation decisions and increasing
> functionality at a relatively consistent rate.
>
> Those who use the TDD approach profess the following benefits of the
> practice:
>
> - TDD entices programmers to write code
> that is automatically testable, such as returning a value for
> Calculator.sum (in the first scenario) instead of having that method
> print the results to the screen. If programs are written without
> continual consideration toward being automatically testable, writing
> such test cases after the fact can be very difficult, if not
> impossible. Benefits of automated testing include:
>
> (1) production of a reliable system, (2) improvement of the quality of
    > the test effort, and (3) reduction of the test effort and
    > minimization of the schedule. (Dustin et al. 1999)
>
> - Historically, \"debugging is a
> bottleneck in programming (Ducasse and Emde 1988).\" However, TDD
> provides the programmer with immediate feedback on the correctness of
> the code. As a result, defects and their causes can be easily
> identified. The defect must lie in the code that was just written or
> in code with which the recently added code interacts. An often cited
> tenet of software engineering, in concert with the Cost of Change
> (Boehm 1981), is that the longer a defect remains in a software system
> the more difficult and costly it is to remove. With TDD, defects are
> identified very quickly, and the source of the defect is more easily
> determined.
>
> - The TDD test case assets create a
> through regression test bed. By continually running these automated
> test cases, one can easily identify if a change breaks anything in the
> existing system.
>
> - The automated, extensive regression
> testing that is enabled by TDD should allow smooth integration of new
> functionality into the code base.
>
> - As shown in the second scenario, TDD
> can make or alter our design decisions to simplify our code and add
> flexibility to our system
>
> TDD is not meant to imply that test cases can be written only prior to
> code implementation. Additional test cases can certainly be added
> after code has been written. Specific integration tests are often
> written after code.

### Some Results

> Jeff Langr of ObjectMentor compares two implementations of identical
> code---one written without TDD and one with TDD. The original code had
> six methods (the average method size was 25 lines; the longest was
> over 100 lines of code) and 15 test cases. He found the code hard to
> modify. When he redid the code with TDD, the new code had 23 methods
> (average method size was five lines, the longest was 18 lines of code)
> and 20 tests.
>
> Small methods can increase maintainability, communicability, and
> extensibility of code (Langr 2001).
>
> Additionally, Laurie and her graduate student, Boby George, ran a
> short, controlled TDD experiment with 150 students in her senior-level
> software engineering class at North Carolina State University (George
> 2002). The students were given a short programming problem to write
> code to compute bowling scores. The students were
>
> to implement the scoring during their 75-minute lab period (this was
> very time constrained). All students worked in pairs. Half the
> students were deemed TDD pairs while the other half were non-TDD
> pairs. The student code was tested using seven black box test cases.
> The results follow:

|                                               | TDD** |  **Non-TDD** |

+-----------------------------------------------+-------+--------------+

> Not only did the TDD pairs pass more test cases, but they also had
> programs with fewer lines of code. Programs that perform the same
> functionality with fewer lines of code are considered to have superior
> design and to require less maintenance costs (Boehm 1981).
>

### TDD Without High-Low-Level Design

> With Extreme Programming (XP), developers do not formally prepare
> high- or low-level designs. Developers work in pairs and informally
> apply any design techniques they feel are appropriate for the problem
> at hand. For example, they might brainstorm the class structure by
> performing a CRC card session (Bellin 1997) or draft out a UML class
> diagram (Fowler 2000; Jacobson et al. 1999) that is not inspected,
> archived, or shared.
>
> Alternatively, they start implementation by writing automated unit
> test cases without any design. For developers who work in this way,
> refactoring, as professed by Martin Fowler (1999), in concert with TDD
> is essential.
>
> Through refactoring, the internal structure of code is improved
> without altering its external behavior. With XP, developers understand
> that they might not arrive at the \"best\" design the first time they
> implement the code. After successfully writing test cases and
> implementing the code for new functionality, the developers look back
> through the code to see if any structural improvements can be made.
> The automated test cases give the developer the confidence that the
> structural improvements he or she makes do not alter the behavior of
> the system.
>

### TDD With High-Low-Level Design

> Many software development processes, particularly those involving
> life-and safety-critical applications, necessitate architectural,
> high- and low-level designs. TDD is just as beneficial to these
> processes. Consider Scenario One in this section of the proposal. If
> this software developer knew, based on his or her design documents,
> that there was a calculator class with a sum method, he or she would
> still write the test case before the code. With TDD after design, the
> developer is able to
>
> - ensure the new functionality is
> automatically testable. Perhaps being automatically testable was not
> an initial design consideration; the developer can immediately alter
> the design to allow for testability.
>
> - be provided with immediate feedback on
> the correctness of the new functionality. If the sum method is
> incorrect and the result of the sum method is incorporated into more
> complex functionality, problem determination is significantly more
> difficult once it is determined that the more complex functionality is
> not performing as expected.
>
> - be provided with immediate feedback if
> the new functionality is causing undesirable behavior elsewhere in the
> code base; regression testing is automatically performed by running
> every test case that has been included in the code base. This feedback
> is predicated on the fact that the code base also has a thorough set
> of automated test cases.
>
> - integrate his or her code into the
> code base without incident.
>
> - alter the previously prepared design
> for simplicity or flexibility or new knowledge. Quite often, even
> meticulously prepared and inspected designs are changed when the code
> is actually implemented. This is not changed with TDD, although these
> changes might present themselves more rapidly through the short
> incremental development.
>
> It is important to note that TDD can be implemented in essentially any
> development process simply by shifting from \"unit test after
> implementing\" to \"unit test before implementing.\" Additionally,
> refactoring is a good practice in any process, although its
> criticality is lessened when architecture and design have been
> completed and inspected.
>

### Tool Support

> Many TDD programmers use the open source xUnit automated regression
> test frameworks. A complete listing of all supported languages, which
> includes Java, C++, http, Perl, Ruby, Scheme and Visual Basic is
> available at
> [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestingFramework](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki%40TestingFramework).
> Other commercial tools are also available, including Silvermark Test
> Mentor and Parasoft JTest. The simplicity of the open source tools
> makes them the most popular among many TDD programmers.
